Welcome to INN 2.0!

  This is the public release of version 2.0 of InterNet News (INN). This work
  is sponsored by the Internet Software Consortium.

  This release is a major upgrade from previous versions, hence the change
  from major version 1 to 2. Please see the INSTALL document for installation
  and upgrade instructions.

Reporting Bugs

  We're gathering information on who uses INN. Please do the following

        uname -a | Mail -s "2.0 usage survey" inn-survey@isc.org

  We appreciate it. You won't get a reply.

  We're interested in all bug reports. Not just on the programs, but on
  the documentation too. Please send *all* such reports to:

        inn-bugs@isc.org

  even if you post to usenet, please CC the above address. All other
  INN mail should go to:

        inn@isc.org
  
  (please do *not* send bug reports to this address)

  For general "how do I do this" questions you should post to
  news.software.nntp as there are a lot of experienced INN users there, and 
  there isn't the time necessary to answer general questions

  Have fun!

Who's Responsible / Who to Thank

  See the CONTRIBUTORS file for a long list of past constributors as well 
  as people from the inn-workers mailing list who have dedicated a
  lot of time and effort to getting this new version together. They deserve
  a big round of applause. They've certainly got my thanks.

Supporting the INN Effort

  Note that INN is supported by the Internet Software Consortium, and although
  it is free for use and redistribution and incorporation into vendor products
  and export and anything else you can think of, it costs money to produce.
  That money comes from ISP's, hardware and software vendors, companies who
  make extensive use of the software, and generally kind hearted folk such as
  yourself.  

  The Internet Software Consortium has also commissioned a DHCP server
  implementation, handles the official support/release of BIND, and supports
  the Kerberos Version 5 effort at MIT.  You can learn more about the ISC's
  goals and accomplishments from the web page at <URL:http://www.isc.org/isc/>.

Some History

  1.4sec was the last release produced by Rich Salz, the original author of
  INN. 1.4sec came out in the middle of 1993. After that Rich was unable to
  dedicate the time necessary to maintain it (and I now fully understand why).
  Dave Barr unofficially took over and produced 4 releases with a lot of help
  from the user community. Dave's 4 releases contained a lot of bug fixes and
  some functionality additions.

  Rich Salz, at the beginning of 1996, handed the source pool over to me as
  part of the agreement that the ISC would take over maintenance and
  development of future INN releases. Starting with Rich's post 1.4 source
  pool, I merged in the changes that had occured through the four 'unoff'
  versions, and then added quite a few bug fixes, enhancements etc.
