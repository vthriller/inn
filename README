Welcome to INN 2.3!

  This is the current development version of INN 2.3.  This code is
  under active development and may or may not be stable at any given
  time.  Contributions and bug reports are welcome and encouraged.

  This work is sponsored by the Internet Software Consortium.

  Please see the INSTALL document for installation instructions.
  See the NEWS file for what's changed from the previous release.

What is INN?

  INN (InterNetNews), originally written by Rich Salz, is an extremely
  flexible and configurable Usenet / netnews news server.  For a
  complete description of the protocols behind Usenet and netnews, see
  RFC 1036 and RFC 977 (or their replacements).  In brief, netnews is a
  set of protocols for exchanging messages between a decentralized
  network of news servers.  News articles are organized into newsgroups,
  which are themselves organized into hierarchies.  Each individual news
  server stores locally all articles it has received for a given
  newsgroup, making access to stored articles extremely fast.  Netnews
  does not require any central server; instead, each news server passes
  along articles it receives to all of the news servers it peers with,
  those servers pass the articles along to their peers, and so on,
  resulting in "flood fill" propagation of news articles.

  A news server performs three basic functions:  It accepts articles
  from other servers and stores them on disk, sends articles it has
  received out to other servers, and offers stored news articles to
  readers on demand.  It additionally has to perform some periodic
  maintenance tasks, such as deleting older articles to make room for
  new ones.

  Originally, a news server would just store all of the news articles it
  had received in a file system.  Users could then read news by reading
  the article files on disk (or more commonly using news reading
  software that did this efficiently).  These days, news servers are
  almost always stand-alone systems and news reading is supported via
  network connections.  A user who wants to read a newsgroup opens that
  newsgroup in their newsreader software, which opens a network
  connection to the news server and sends requests for articles and
  related information.  The protocol that a newsreader uses to talk to a
  news server and that a news server uses to talk to another news server
  over TCP/IP is called NNTP (Network News Transport Protocol).

  INN supports accepting articles via either NNTP connections or via
  UUCP.  innd, the heard of INN, handles NNTP feeding connections
  directly; UUCP newsfeeds use rnews (included in INN) to hand articles
  off to innd.  Other parts of INN handle feeding articles out to other
  news servers, most commonly innfeed (for real-time outgoing feeds) or
  nntpsend and innxmit (used to send batches of news created by innd to
  a remote site via TCP/IP).  INN can also handle outgoing UUCP feeds.

  The part of INN that handles connections from newsreaders is nnrpd.

  Also included in INN are a wide variety of supporting programs to
  handle periodic maintenance and recovery from crashes, process special
  control messages, maintain the list of active newsgroups, and generate
  and record a staggering variety of statistics and summary information
  on the usage and performance of the server.

  INN also supports an extremely powerful filtering system that allows
  the server administrator to reject unwanted articles (such as spam and
  other abuses of Usenet).

  INN is free software, supported by the Internet Software Consortium
  and volunteers around the world.  See the section on Supporting the
  INN Effort below.

Prerequisites

  Compiling INN requires an ANSI C compiler (gcc is recommended).  INN
  was originally written in K&R C, but supporting pre-ANSI compilers has
  become enough of a headache that a lot of the newer parts of INN will
  no longer compile with a non-ANSI compiler.  gcc itself will compile
  with most vendor non-ANSI compilers, however, so if you're stuck with
  one, installing gcc is highly recommended.  Not only will it let you
  build INN, it will make installing lots of other software much easier.
  You may also need GNU make (particularly if your system make is
  BSD-derived), although most SysV make programs should work fine.

  INN uses GNU autoconf to probe the capabilities of your system, and
  therefore should compile on nearly any Unix system.  See INSTALL for a
  list of systems it is known to work on.  If you encounter problems
  compiling or running INN, or if you successfully run INN on a platform
  that isn't listed in INSTALL, please let us know (see Reporting Bugs
  below).

  Perl, at least Perl 4, is required to build INN.  Perl 5.004 is
  required if you want the embedded Perl filter support (which is highly
  recommended; some excellent spam filters have been written for INN).
  Since all versions of Perl previous to 5.004 are buggy (including
  security problems) and have fewer features, installing Perl 5.004 or
  later is recommended.

  If you want to enable PGP verification of control messages (highly
  recommended), you will need to have PGP installed.  See INSTALL for
  more details.

Getting Started

  A news server can be a fairly complicated piece of software to set up
  just because of the wide variety of pieces that have to be configured
  (who is authorized to read from the server, what newsgroups it
  carries, and how the articles are stored on disk at a bare minimum,
  and if the server isn't completely stand-alone -- and very few servers
  are -- both incoming and outgoing feeds have to be set up and tested).
  Be prepared to take some time to understand what's going on and how
  all the pieces fit together.  If you have any specific suggestions for
  documentation, or comments about things that are unclear, please send
  them to the INN maintainers (see Reporting Bugs below).

  See the INSTALL file for step-by-step instructions for setting up and
  configuring a news server.

  INN also comes with a very complete set of man pages; there is a man
  page for every configuration file and program that comes with INN.
  (If you find one that doesn't have a man page, that's a bug.  Please
  do report it.)  When trying to figure out some specific problem,
  reading the man pages for all of the configuration files involved is a
  very good start.

Reporting Bugs

  We're interested in all bug reports. Not just on the programs, but on
  the documentation too.  Please send *all* such reports to:

        inn-bugs@isc.org

  even if you post to usenet, please CC the above address.  All other
  INN mail should go to:

        inn@isc.org
  
  (please do *not* send bug reports to this address)

  For general "how do I do this" questions you should post to
  news.software.nntp as there are a lot of experienced INN users there,
  and there isn't the time necessary to answer general questions.

  Have fun!

Who's Responsible / Who to Thank

  See the CONTRIBUTORS file for a long list of past contributors as
  well as people from the inn-workers mailing list who have dedicated
  a lot of time and effort to getting this new version together.  They
  deserve a big round of applause.  They've certainly got our thanks.

  Last, but certainly not least, Rich Salz, the original author of INN
  deserves a lion's share of the credit for writing INN in the first 
  place and making it the most popular news server software on the 
  planet (no NNTP yet to the moon, but we plan to be there first).

Supporting the INN Effort

  Note that INN is supported by the Internet Software Consortium,
  and although it is free for use and redistribution and incorporation
  into vendor products and export and anything else you can think of,
  it costs money to produce.  That money comes from ISP's, hardware and
  software vendors, companies who make extensive use of the software,
  and generally kind hearted folk such as yourself.

  The Internet Software Consortium has also commissioned a DHCP
  server implementation, handles the official support/release of BIND,
  and supports the Kerberos Version 5 effort at MIT.  You can learn
  more about the ISC's goals and accomplishments from the web page at
