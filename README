Welcome to INN 2.2!

  This work is sponsored by the Internet Software Consortium.

  Please see the INSTALL document for installation instructions.
  See the NEWS file for what's changed from the previous release.

Reporting Bugs

  We're interested in all bug reports. Not just on the programs, but on
  the documentation too. Please send *all* such reports to:

        inn-bugs@isc.org

  even if you post to usenet, please CC the above address. All other
  INN mail should go to:

        inn@isc.org
  
  (please do *not* send bug reports to this address)

  For general "how do I do this" questions you should post to
  news.software.nntp as there are a lot of experienced INN users there,
  and there isn't the time necessary to answer general questions.

  Have fun!

Who's Responsible / Who to Thank

  See the CONTRIBUTORS file for a long list of past contributors as
  well as people from the inn-workers mailing list who have dedicated
  a lot of time and effort to getting this new version together. They
  deserve a big round of applause. They've certainly got our thanks.

  Last, but certainly not least, Rich Salz, the original author of INN
  deserves a lion's share of the credit for writing INN in the first 
  place and making it the most popular news server software on the 
  planet (no NNTP yet to the moon, but we plan to be there first)..

Supporting the INN Effort

  Note that INN is supported by the Internet Software Consortium,
  and although it is free for use and redistribution and incorporation
  into vendor products and export and anything else you can think of,
  it costs money to produce.  That money comes from ISP's, hardware and
  software vendors, companies who make extensive use of the software,
  and generally kind hearted folk such as yourself.

  The Internet Software Consortium has also commissioned a DHCP
  server implementation, handles the official support/release of BIND,
  and supports the Kerberos Version 5 effort at MIT.  You can learn
  more about the ISC's goals and accomplishments from the web page at
  <URL:http://www.isc.org/isc/>.
