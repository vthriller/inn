.TH STORAGE.CONF 5
.SH NAME
storage.conf \- configuration file for storage manager
.SH DESCRIPTION
The file
.I <pathetc in inn.conf>/storage.conf
is required if storage API is used.
Storage API is turned on if ``storageapi: true'' in
.IR inn.conf (5).
.PP
The file consists of a series of storage method entries;
blank lines and lines beginning with a number sign (``#'') are ignored.
If spaces or tabs are included in the value, that value must be quoted
with ``"''.
The order of entries in this file is important.
.PP
Each entry is formatted as:
.PP
.RS
.nf
method <methodname> {
	newsgroups: <wildmat>
	class: <storage_class>
	size: <minsize>[,<maxsize>]
	expires: <mintime>[,<maxtime>]
	options: <options>
}
.fi
.RE
.PP
The ``methodname'' is the name of storage method.
Currently, ``timecaf'', ``timehash'', ``cnfs'', ``tradspool'' and ``trash''
are available for its name.
See STORAGE METHODS section for those method.
\&``Wildmat'' refers to a newsgroup pattern that will be parsed with
.IR wildmat (3).
Matching newsgroup is against newsgroup name in ``Xref'' header, if
\&``storeonxref'' in inn.conf is ``true.''
Otherwise, it is against newsgroup name in ``Newsgroups'' header.
\&``!'' and ``@'' are allowed at the start of the wildmat and
refer to pattern exclusions. See
.IR newsfeeds (5)
for a description of their use.  The ``wildmat'' is matched in order.
There is no default ``wildmat'' pattern, so specified ``wildmat''
is only used for matching.
\&``Storage_class'' is an identifier among all entries.
\&``Storage_class'' is also referred at
.IR expire.ctl (5).
\&``Minsize'' and ``maxsize'' is the range in which article is stored.
If ``maxsize'' is ``0'', article upper size is unlimited.
\&``options'' is method specific option which is needed only for some
method. See STORAGE METHODS sectoin for a description of its use.
\&``Mintime'' and ``maxtime'' are the times into the future the `Expires:'
header for the article indicates that it should be expired, and are
formatted 0d0h0m0s, for days, hours, minutes and seconds into the future.
If ``mintime'' is non-zero, the storage method will not match an article
without an 'Expires:' header.  If ``maxtime'' is ``0s'', there is no upper
bound on the expire time for the article to fall in this entry.
Note that ``expires'' parameter never controls expire time.  This is
used just for determining storage class based on ``Expires:'' header.
.PP
If a newsgroup matches wildmat pattern and the range, the article is stored
in that ``storage_class.''
Note that the file is interpreted in order and first match line
is used to store an article.
.PP
If a newsgroup does not match any wildmat pattern nor the range in all entries, 
the article is not stored and
.IR innd (8)
rejects it.
.SH STORAGE METHODS
.TP
.B cnfs
\&``Cnfs'' method stores articles in preconfigured files cyclically.
So, if storing position reaches at the end of the file,
the position is moved to the beginning of the file and
old articles are overwritten to write new articles.
This method is assumed to have self expire functionality.
There is a configuration file,
.IR cycbuff.conf ,
for this method and ``options'' field is needed.
See
.IR cycbuff.conf (5)
for description of thier use.
.TP
.B timecaf
\&``Timecaf'' method stores multiple articles in one file whose path name
is based on article's arrival time.  The path name is created as
.IR <patharticles\ in\ inn.conf>/timecaf-nn/bb/aacc.CF .
Where ``nn'' is hexa decimal value of ``storage_class.''
Where ``bb'' and ``aacc'' are hexa decimal value of splitted
arrival time and between 0xaabbcc00 and 0xaabbccFF is the actual time.
There is no configuration file for this method.
.TP
.B timehash
\&``Timehash'' method stores each article into each file whose path name
is based on article's arrival time.  The path name is created as
.IR <patharticles\ in\ inn.conf>/time-xx/bb/cc/yyyy-aadd .
Where ``xx'' is hexa decimal value of ``storage_class.''
Where ``yyyy'' is hexa decimal value of sequence number.
Where ``bb'', ``cc'' and ``aadd'' are hexa decimal value of splitted
arrival time and 0xaabbccdd is the actual time.
There is no configuration file for this method.
.TP
.B tradspool
\&``Tradspool'' method stores each article in a way that traditional
former INN (before 2.0) stores. The path name is created like
.IR <patharticles\ in\ inn.conf>/news/group/name/nnnnn .
Where ``news/group/name'' is the `news.group.name'' to which article is posted.
Where nnnnn is the article numbers that article has in that newsgroup.
And if the article is crossposted, that file is symbolic linked and the
name convention is like above.
There is no configuration file for this method.
.TP
.B trash
\&``Trash'' method stores no article and this can be used simply to
trash the article but the article is accepted without any problem.
For this reason, any article stored through this method never can be
retrieved and this method is assumed to have self expire functionality.
There is no configuration file for this method.
