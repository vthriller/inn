.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Archive
makes copies of files specified on its standard input.
It is normally run either as a channel feed under
.IR innd (8),
or by a script before
.IR expire (8)
is run.
.PP
.I Archive
reads the named
.I input
file, or standard input if no file is given.
The input is taken as a sequence of lines;
blank lines and lines starting with a number sign (``#'') are ignored.
All other lines should specify the token of an article to archive.
Every article is retrieved from a token,
and the Xref: header is used to determine the target file in the
archive directory.
You can limit the targets taken from the Xref: header with the ``\-p'' option.
.PP
Files are copied to a directory within the archive directory,
.IR <patharchive\ in\ inn.conf> .
The default is to create a hierarchy that mimics the input files;
intermediate directories will be created as needed.
For example, if the input token represents article 2211 in the newsgroup
comp.sources.unix,
.IR archive
will generate a copy in
.IR <patharchive\ in\ inn.conf>/comp/sources/unix/2211 .
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-a\ archive
If the ``\-a'' flag is used then its argument specifies the directory to
archive in instead of
.IR <patharchive\ in\ inn.conf> .
.TP
.B \-c
If the ``\-c'' flag is used, then directory names will be flattened as if
by the ``\-f'' flag; additionally, all posts will be concatenated into a
.B single\ file ,
appending if the file already exists, with the final component of the
filename being YYYYMM based on the local execution time of
.IR archive.
In this case, on December 14, 1998, the file would be copied to
.IR <patharchive\ in\ inn.conf>/comp.sources.unix/199812 .
.TP
.B \-f
If the ``\-f'' flag is used, then all directory names will be
flattened out, replacing the slashes with periods.
In this case, the file would be copied to
.IR <patharchive\ in\ inn.conf>/comp.sources.unix/2211 .
.TP
.B \-i
If the ``\-i'' flag is used, then
.I archive
will append one line to the specified
.I index
file for each article that it copies.
This line will contain the destination name as well as the Message-ID and
Subject headers.
.TP 
.B \-p newsgroup-list
Limits the targets taken from the Xref: header to the groups specified in
.I newsgroup-list.
The
.I newsgroup-list
is a comma-separated 
.IR uwildmat (3)
list of newsgroups you wish to have
.IR archive
handle.
.TP 
.B \-r
By default,
.I archive
sets its standard error to
.IR <pathlog\ in\ inn.conf>/errlog .
To suppress this redirection, use the ``\-r'' flag.
.SH EXIT STATUS
If the input is exhausted,
.I archive
will exit with a zero status.
If an I/O error occures, it will try to spool its input, copying it to a file.
If there was no input filename, the standard input will be copied to
.I <pathoutgoing in inn.conf>/archive
and the program will exit.
If an input filename was given, a temporary file named
.IR input .bch
(if
.I input
is an absolute pathname)
or
.I <pathoutgoing in inn.conf>/input.bch
(if the filename does not begin with a slash) is created.
Once the input is copied,
.I archive
will try to rename this temporary file to be the name of the input file,
and then exit.

.SH EXAMPLES
A typical
.IR newsfeeds (5)
entry to archive most source newsgroups is as follows:
.PP
.RS
.nf
source-archive\e
	:!*,*sources*,!*wanted*,!*.d\e
	:Tc,Wn\e
	:<pathbin in inn.conf>/archive \-f \-i \e
	    <patharchive in inn.conf>/INDEX
