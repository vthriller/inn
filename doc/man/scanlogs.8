.SH DESCRIPTION

summarizes the information recorded in the INN log files (see

By default, it also rotates and cleans out the logs.
It is normally invoked by the
.IR news.daily (8)
script.
.SH KEYWORDS
.PP
The following keywords are accepted:
.TP
.I norotate
Using this keyword disables the rotating and cleaning aspect of the log
processing: the logs files are only scanned for information and no contents
are altered.
.PP
If
.I scanlogs
is invoked more than once a day, the ``norotate'' keyword should be used
to prevent premature log cleaning.
