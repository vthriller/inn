.IX Title "READERS.CONF 5"
.TH READERS.CONF 5 "2005-04-11" "INN 2.5.0" "InterNetNews Documentation"
.SH "NAME"
readers.conf \- Access control and configuration for nnrpd
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fIreaders.conf\fR in \fIpathetc\fR specifies access control for \fInnrpd\fR\|(8).  It
controls who is allowed to connect as a news reader and what they're
allowed to do after they connect.  nnrpd reads this file when it starts
up.  This generally means that any changes take effect immediately on all
subsequent connections, but \fBnnrpd\fR may have to be restarted if you use
the \fB\-D\fR option.  (The location \fIpathetc\fR/readers.conf is only the
default; the same format applies to any file specified with \f(CW\*(C`nnrpd \-c\*(C'\fR.)
.PP
There are two types of entries in \fIreaders.conf\fR:  parameter/value pairs
and configuration groups.  Blank lines and anything after a number sign
(\f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR) are ignored, unless the character \f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR is escaped with \f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR.  The
maximum number of characters on each line is 8,191.
.PP
Parameter/value pairs consist of a keyword immediately followed by a
colon, at least one whitespace character, and a value.  The case of the
parameter is significant (parameter should generally be in all lowercase),
and a parameter may contain any characters except colon, \f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR, and
whitespace.  An example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    hosts: *.example.com
.Ve
.PP
Values that contain whitespace should be quoted with double quotes, as in:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    hosts: "*.example.com, *.example.net"
.Ve
.PP
If the parameter does not contain whitespace, such as:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    hosts: *.example.com,*.example.net
.Ve
.PP
it's not necessary to quote it, although you may wish to anyway for
clarity.
.PP
There is no way to continue a line on the next line, and therefore no way
to have a single parameter with a value longer than about 8,180
characters.
.PP
Many parameters take a boolean value.  For all such parameters, the value
may be specified as \f(CW\*(C`true\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`yes\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`on\*(C'\fR to turn it on and may be any
of \f(CW\*(C`false\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`no\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`off\*(C'\fR to turn it off.  The case of these values is
not significant.
.PP
There are two basic types of configuration groups, auth and access.  The
auth group provides mechanisms to establish the identity of the user, who
they are.  The access group determines, given the user's identity, what
that user is permitted to do.  Writing a \fIreaders.conf\fR file for your
setup is a two-step process: first assigning an identity to each incoming
connection using auth groups, and then giving each identity appropriate
privileges with access group.  We recommend \fInot\fR intermingling auth
groups and access groups in the config file; it is often more sensible (in
the absence of the \fIkey\fR parameter) to put all of the auth groups first,
and all of the access groups below.
.PP
A user identity, as established by an auth group, looks like an e\-mail
address; in other words, it's in the form \*(L"<username>@<domain>\*(R" (or
sometimes just \*(L"<username>\*(R" if no domain is specified.
.PP
If \fInnrpdauthsender\fR is set in \fIinn.conf\fR, the user identity is also put
into the Sender: header of posts made by that user.  See the documentation
of that option in \fIinn.conf\fR\|(5) for more details.
.PP
An auth group definition looks like:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&    auth <name> {
\&        hosts: <host\-wildmat>
\&        auth: <auth\-program>
\&        res: <res\-program>
\&        default: <defuser>
\&        default\-domain: <defdomain>
\&        # ...possibly other settings
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
The <name> is used as a label for the group and is only for documentation
purposes.  (If your syslog configuration records the \f(CW\*(C`news.debug\*(C'\fR
facility, the <name> will appear in the debugging output of nnrpd.
Examining that output can be very helpful in understanding why your
configuration doesn't do what you expect it to.)
.PP
A given auth group applies only to hosts whose name or \s-1IP\s0 address matches
the wildmat expression given with the hosts: parameter (comma\-separated
wildmat expressions allowed, but \f(CW\*(C`@\*(C'\fR is not supported).  Rather than
wildmat expressions, you may also use \s-1CIDR\s0 notation to match any \s-1IP\s0
address in a netblock; for example, \*(L"10.10.10.0/24\*(R" will match any \s-1IP\s0
address between 10.10.10.0 and 10.10.10.255 inclusive.
.PP
If compiled against the \s-1SSL\s0 libraries, an auth group with the require_ssl:
parameter set to true only applies if the incoming connection is using
\&\s-1SSL\s0.
.PP
For any connection from a host that matches that wildmat expression or
netblock, each <res\-program> (multiple res: lines may be present in a
block; they are run in sequence until one succeeds), if any, is run to
determine the identity of the user just from the connection information.
If all the resolvers fail, or if the res: parameter isn't present, the
user is assigned an identity of \*(L"<defuser>@<defdomain>\*(R"; in other words,
the values of the default: and default\-domain: parameters are used.  If
<res\-program> only returns a username, <defdomain> is used as the
domain.
.PP
If the user later authenticates via the \s-1AUTHINFO\s0 \s-1USER/PASS\s0 commands,
the provided username and password are passed to each <auth\-program>
(multiple auth, perl_auth, or python_auth lines may be present in a
block; they are run in sequence until one succeeds), if any.  If one
succeeds and returns a different identity than the one assigned at the
time of the connection, it is matched against the available access
groups again and the actions the user is authorized to do may change.
.PP
When matching auth groups, the last auth group in the file that matches a
given connection and username/password combination is used.
.PP
An access group definition usually looks like:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    access <name> {
\&        users: <identity\-wildmat>
\&        newsgroups: <group\-wildmat>
\&        # ...possibly other settings
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Again, <name> is just for documentation purposes.  This says that all
users whose identity matches <identity\-wildmat> can read and post to all
newsgroups matching <group\-wildmat> (as before, comma-separated wildmat
expressions are allowed, but \f(CW\*(C`@\*(C'\fR is not supported).  Alternately, you can
use the form:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    access <name> {
\&        users: <identity\-wildmat>
\&        read: <read\-wildmat>
\&        post: <post\-wildmat>
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
and matching users will be able to read any group that matches
<read\-wildmat> and post to any group that matches <post\-wildmat>.  You can
also set several other things in the access group as well as override
various \fIinn.conf\fR\|(5) parameters for just a particular group of users.
.PP
Just like with auth groups, when matching access groups the last matching
one in the file is used to determine the user's permissions.  There is
an exception to this rule: if the auth group which matched the client
contains a perl_access: or python_access: parameter, then the script
given as argument is used to dynamically generate an access group.
This new access group is then used to determine the access rights of
the client; the access groups in the file are ignored.
.PP
There is one additional special case to be aware of.  When forming
particularly complex authentication and authorization rules, it is
sometimes useful for the identities provided by a given auth group to only
apply to particular access groups; in other words, rather than checking
the identity against the users: parameter of every access group, it's
checked against the users: parameter of only some specific access groups.
This is done with the key: parameter.  For example:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    auth example {
\&        key: special
\&        hosts: *.example.com
\&        default: <SPECIAL>
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    access example {
\&        key: special
\&        users: <SPECIAL>
\&        newsgroups: *
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
In this case, the two key: parameters bind this auth group with this
access group.  For any incoming connection matching \*(L"*.example.com\*(R"
(assuming there isn't any later auth group that also matches such hosts),
no access group that doesn't have \*(L"key: special\*(R" will even be considered.
Similarly, the above access group will only be checked if the user was
authenticated with an auth group containing \*(L"key: special\*(R".  This
mechanism normally isn't useful; there is almost always a better way to
achieve the same result.
.PP
Also note in the example that there's no default\-domain: parameter, which
means that no domain is appended to the default username and the identity
for such connections is just \*(L"<\s-1SPECIAL\s0>\*(R".  Note that some additional
add-ons to \s-1INN\s0 may prefer that authenticated identities always return a
full e\-mail address (including a domain), so you may want to set up your
system that way.
.PP
Below is the full list of allowable parameters for auth groups and access
groups, and after that are some examples that may make this somewhat
clearer.
.SH "AUTH GROUP PARAMETERS"
.IX Header "AUTH GROUP PARAMETERS"
.IP "\fBhosts:\fR" 4
.IX Item "hosts:"
A comma-separated list of remote hosts, wildmat patterns matching either
hostnames or \s-1IP\s0 addresses, or \s-1IP\s0 netblocks specified in \s-1CIDR\s0 notation.  If
a user connects from a host that doesn't match this parameter, this auth
group will not match the connection and is ignored.
.Sp
Note that if you have a large number of patterns that can't be merged into
broader patterns (such as a large number of individual systems scattered
around the net that should have access), the hosts: parameter may exceed
the maximum line length of 8,192 characters.  In that case, you'll need to
break that auth group into multiple auth groups, each with a portion of
the hosts listed in its hosts: parameter, and each assigning the same user
identity.
.Sp
All hosts match if this parameter is not given.
.IP "\fBlocaladdress:\fR" 4
.IX Item "localaddress:"
A comma-separated list of local host or address patterns with the same
syntax as the same as with the hosts: parameter.  If this parameter is
specified, its auth group will only match connections made to a matching
local interface.  (Obviously, this is only useful for servers with
multiple interfaces.)
.Sp
All local addresses match if this parameter is not given.
.IP "\fBres:\fR" 4
.IX Item "res:"
A simple command line for a user resolver (shell metacharacters are not
supported).  If a full path is not given, the program executed must be in
the \fIpathbin\fR/auth/resolv directory.  A resolver is an authentication
program which attempts to figure out the identity of the connecting user
using nothing but the connection information (in other words, the user
has not provided a username and password).  An examples of a resolver
would be a program that assigns an identity from an ident callback or
from the user's hostname.
.Sp
One auth group can have multiple res: parameters, and they will be tried
in the order they're listed.  The results of the first successful one
will be used.
.IP "\fBauth:\fR" 4
.IX Item "auth:"
A simple command line for a user authenticator (shell metacharacters are
not supported).  If a full path is not given, the program executed must be
located in the \fIpathbin\fR/auth/passwd directory.  An authenticator is a
program used to handle a user-supplied username and password, via a
mechanism such as \s-1AUTHINFO\s0 \s-1USER/PASS\s0.  Like with res:, one auth group
can have multiple auth: parameters; they will be tried in order and the
results of the first successful one will be used.  See also perl_auth:
below.
.IP "\fBperl_auth:\fR" 4
.IX Item "perl_auth:"
A path to a perl script for authentication.  The perl_auth: parameter
works exactly like auth:, except that it calls the named script using
the perl hook rather then an external program.  Multiple/mixed use of
the auth, perl_auth, and python_auth parameters is permitted within any
auth group; each line is tried in the order it appears.  perl_auth:
has more power than auth: in that it provides the authentication
program with additional information about the client and the ability
to return an error string and a username.  This parameter is only
valid if \s-1INN\s0 is compiled with Perl support (\fB\-\-with\-perl\fR passed to
configure).  More information may be found in \fIdoc/hook\-perl\fR.
.IP "\fBpython_auth:\fR" 4
.IX Item "python_auth:"
A python script for authentication.  The python_auth: parameter works
exactly like auth:, except that it calls the named script using the
python hook rather then an external program.  Multiple/mixed use of
the auth, perl_auth, and python_auth parameters is permitted within any
auth group; each line is tried in the order it appears.  python_auth:
has more power than auth: in that it provides the authentication
program with additional information about the client and the ability
to return an error string and a username.  This parameter is only
valid if \s-1INN\s0 is compiled with Python support (\fB\-\-with\-python\fR passed
to configure).  More information may be found in \fIdoc/hook\-python\fR.
.IP "\fBdefault:\fR" 4
.IX Item "default:"
The default username for connections matching this auth group.  This is
the username assigned to the user at connection time if all resolvers fail
or if there are no res: parameters.  Note that it can be either a bare
username, in which case default\-domain: (if present) is appended after
an \f(CW\*(C`@\*(C'\fR, or a full identity string containing an \f(CW\*(C`@\*(C'\fR, in which case it
will be used verbatim.
.IP "\fBdefault\-domain:\fR" 4
.IX Item "default-domain:"
The default domain string for this auth group.  If a user resolver or
authenticator doesn't provide a domain, or if the default username is used
and it doesn't contain a \f(CW\*(C`@\*(C'\fR, this domain is used to form the user
identity.  (Note that for a lot of setups, it's not really necessary for
user identities to be qualified with a domain name, in which case there's
no need to use this parameter.)
.IP "\fBkey:\fR" 4
.IX Item "key:"
If this parameter is present, any connection matching this auth group will
have its privileges determined only by the subset of access groups
containing a matching key parameter.
.IP "\fBrequire_ssl:\fR" 4
.IX Item "require_ssl:"
If set to true, an incoming connection only matches this auth group if
it is encrypted using \s-1SSL\s0.  This parameter is only valid if \s-1INN\s0 is
compiled with \s-1SSL\s0 support (\fB\-\-with\-openssl\fR passed to configure).
.IP "\fBperl_access:\fR" 4
.IX Item "perl_access:"
A path to a perl script for dynamically generating an access group.  If
an auth group matches successfully and contains a perl_access parameter,
then the argument perl script will be used to create an access group.
This group will then determine the access rights of the client,
overriding any access groups in \fIreaders.conf\fR.  If and only if a
sucessful auth group contains the perl_access parameter, \fIreaders.conf\fR
access groups are ignored and the client's rights are instead determined
dynamically.  This parameter is only valid if \s-1INN\s0 is compiled with Perl
support (\fB\-\-with\-perl\fR passed to configure).  More information may be
found in the file \fIdoc/hook\-perl\fR.
.IP "\fBpython_access:\fR" 4
.IX Item "python_access:"
A python script for dynamically generating an access group.  If
an auth group matches successfully and contains a python_access parameter,
then the argument script will be used to create an access group.
This group will then determine the access rights of the client,
overriding any access groups in \fIreaders.conf\fR.  If and only if a
successful auth group contains the python_access parameter, \fIreaders.conf\fR
access groups are ignored and the client's rights are instead determined
dynamically.  This parameter is only valid if \s-1INN\s0 is compiled with Python
support (\fB\-\-with\-python\fR passed to configure).  More information may be
found in the file \fIdoc/hook\-python\fR.
.IP "\fBpython_dynamic:\fR" 4
.IX Item "python_dynamic:"
A python script for applying access control dynamically on a per newsgroup
basis.  If an auth group matches successfully and contains a
python_dynamic parameter, then the argument script will be used to
determine the clients rights each time the user attempts to view a
newsgroup, or read or post an article.  Access rights as determined by
python_dynamic override the values of access group parameters such as
newsgroups, read, and post.  This parameter is only valid if \s-1INN\s0 is
compiled with Python support (\fB\-\-with\-python\fR passed to configure).  More
information may be found in the file \fIdoc/hook\-python\fR.
.SH "ACCESS GROUP PARAMETERS"
.IX Header "ACCESS GROUP PARAMETERS"
.IP "\fBusers:\fR" 4
.IX Item "users:"
The privileges given by this access group apply to any user identity which
matches this comma-separated list of wildmat patterns.  If this parameter
isn't given, the access group applies to all users (and is essentially
equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`users: *\*(C'\fR).
.IP "\fBnewsgroups:\fR" 4
.IX Item "newsgroups:"
Users that match this access group are allowed to read and post to all
newsgroups matching this comma-separated list of wildmat patterns.  The
empty string is equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`newsgroups: *\*(C'\fR; if this parameter is
missing, the connection will be rejected (unless read: and/or post: are
used instead, see below).
.IP "\fBread:\fR" 4
.IX Item "read:"
Like the newsgroups: parameter, but the client is only given permission to
read the matching newsgroups.  This parameter is often used with post:
(below) to specify some read-only groups; it cannot be used in the same
access group with a newsgroups: parameter.  (If read: is used and post:
is missing, the client will have only read-only access.)
.IP "\fBpost:\fR" 4
.IX Item "post:"
Like the newsgroups: parameter, but the client is only given permission to
post to the matching newsgroups.  This parameter is often used with read:
(above) to define the patterns for reading and posting separately (usually
to give the user permission to read more newsgroups than they're permitted
to post to).  It cannot be used in the same access group with a
newsgroups: parameter.
.IP "\fBaccess:\fR" 4
.IX Item "access:"
A set of letters specifying the permissions granted to the client.  The
letters are chosen from the following set:
.RS 4
.IP "R" 3
.IX Item "R"
The client may read articles.
.IP "P" 3
.IX Item "P"
The client may post articles.
.IP "I" 3
.IX Item "I"
The client may inject articles with \s-1IHAVE\s0.  Note that in order to
inject articles with the \s-1IHAVE\s0 the user must also have \s-1POST\s0 permission
(the \f(CW\*(C`P\*(C'\fR option).
.IP "A" 3
.IX Item "A"
The client may post articles with Approved: headers (in other words, may
approve articles for moderated newsgroups).  By default, this is not
allowed.
.IP "N" 3
.IX Item "N"
The client may use the \s-1NEWNEWS\s0 command, overriding the global setting.
.IP "L" 3
.IX Item "L"
The client may post to newsgroups that are set to disallow local posting
(mode \f(CW\*(C`n\*(C'\fR in the \fIactive\fR\|(5) file).
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
Note that if this parameter is given, \fIallownewnews\fR in \fIinn.conf\fR is
ignored for connections matching this access group and the ability of the
client to use \s-1NEWNEWS\s0 is entirely determined by the presence of \f(CW\*(C`N\*(C'\fR in
the access string.  If you want to support \s-1NEWNEWS\s0, make sure to include
\&\f(CW\*(C`N\*(C'\fR in the access string when you use this parameter.
.Sp
Note that if this parameter is given and \f(CW\*(C`R\*(C'\fR isn't present in the access
string, the client cannot read regardless of newsgroups: or read:
parameters.  Similarly, if this parameter is given and \f(CW\*(C`P\*(C'\fR isn't present,
the client cannot post.  This use of access: is deprecated and confusing;
it's strongly recommended that if the access: parameter is used, \f(CW\*(C`R\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`P\*(C'\fR always be included in the access string and newsgroups:, read:, and
post: be used to control access.  (To grant read access but no posting
access, one can have just a read: parameter and no post: parameter.)
.RE
.IP "\fBkey:\fR" 4
.IX Item "key:"
If this parameter is present, this access group is only considered when
finding privileges for users matching auth groups with this same key:
parameter.
.IP "\fBreject_with:\fR" 4
.IX Item "reject_with:"
If this parameter is present, a client matching this block will be
disconnected with a \*(L"Permission denied\*(R" message containing the contents
(a \*(L"reason\*(R" string) of this parameter.  Some newsreaders will then
display the reason to the user.
.IP "\fBmax_rate:\fR" 4
.IX Item "max_rate:"
If this parameter is present (and nonzero) it is used for nnrpd's 
rate-limiting code.  The client will only be able to download at this 
speed (in bytes/second).  Note that if \s-1SSL\s0 is being used, limiting
is applied to the pre-encryption datastream.
.IP "\fBlocaltime:\fR" 4
.IX Item "localtime:"
If a Date: header is not included in a posted article, \fInnrpd\fR\|(8) normally
adds a new Date: header in \s-1UTC\s0.  If this is set to true, the Date: header
will be formatted in local time instead.  This is a boolean value and the
default is false.
.IP "\fBnewsmaster:\fR" 4
.IX Item "newsmaster:"
Used as the contact address in the help message returned by \fInnrpd\fR\|(8), if
the virtualhost: parameter is set to true.
.IP "\fBstrippath:\fR" 4
.IX Item "strippath:"
If set to true, any Path: header provided by a user in a post is stripped
rather than used as the beginning of the Path: header of the article.
This is a boolean value and the default is false.
.IP "\fBperlfilter:\fR" 4
.IX Item "perlfilter:"
If set to false, posts made by these users do not pass through the Perl
filter even if it is otherwise enabled.  This is a boolean value and the
default is true.
.IP "\fBpythonfilter:\fR" 4
.IX Item "pythonfilter:"
If set to false, posts made by these users do not pass through the Python
filter even if it is otherwise enabled.  This is a boolean value and the
default is true.
.IP "\fBvirtualhost:\fR" 4
.IX Item "virtualhost:"
Set this parameter to make \fBnnrpd\fR behave as if it's running on a server
with a different name than it actually is.  If you set this parameter, you
must also set either pathhost: or domain: to something different than is
set in \fIinn.conf\fR.  All articles displayed to clients will then have
their Path: and Xref: headers altered to appear to be from the server
named in pathhost: or domain: (whichever is set), and posted articles will
use that server name in the Path:, Message\-ID;, and X\-Trace: headers.
.Sp
Note that setting this parameter requires the server modify all posts
before presenting them to the client and therefore may decrease
performance slightly.
.PP
In addition, all of the following parameters are valid in access groups
and override the global setting in \fIinn.conf\fR.  See \fIinn.conf\fR\|(5) for the
descriptions of these parameters:  addnntppostingdate, addnntppostinghost,
backoff_auth, backoff_db, backoff_k, backoff_postfast, backoff_postslow,
backoff_trigger, checkincludedtext, clienttimeout, complaints, domain,
fromhost, localmaxartsize, moderatormailer, nnrpdauthsender,
nnrpdcheckart, nnrpdoverstats, nnrpdposthost, nnrpdpostport, organization,
pathhost, readertrack, spoolfirst, and strippostcc.
.SH "SUMMARY"
.IX Header "SUMMARY"
Here's a basic summary of what happens when a client connects:
.IP "\(bu" 2
All auth groups are scanned and the ones that don't match the client
(due to hosts:, localaddress:, require_ssl:, etc) are eliminated.
.IP "\(bu" 2
The remaining auth groups are scanned from the last to the first, and an
attempt is made to apply it to the current connection.  This means running
res: programs, if any, and otherwise applying default:.  The first auth
group (starting from the bottom) to return a valid user is kept as the
active auth group.
.IP "\(bu" 2
If no auth groups yield a valid user (none have default: parameters or
successful res: programs) but some of the auth groups have auth: lines
(indicating a possibility that the user can authenticate and then obtain
permissions), the connection is considered to have no valid auth group
(which means that the access groups are ignored completely) but the
connection isn't closed.  Instead, 480 is returned for everything until
the user authenticates.
.IP "\(bu" 2
When the user authenticates, the auth groups are rescanned, and only the
matching ones which contain at least one auth, perl_auth, or
python_auth line are considered.  These auth groups are scanned from
the last to the first, running auth: programs and perl_auth: or
python_auth: scripts.  The first auth group (starting from the bottom)
to return a valid user is kept as the active auth group.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Regardless of how an auth group is established, as soon as one is, that
auth group is used to assign a user identity by taking the result of the
successful res, auth, perl_auth, or python_auth line (or the
default: if necessary), and appending the default-domain if
necessary.  (If the perl_access: or python_access: parameter is
present, see below.)
.IP "\(bu" 2
Finally, an access group is selected by scanning the access groups from
bottom up and finding the first match.  (If the established auth group
contained a perl_access: or python_access line, the dynamically
generated access group returned by the script is used instead.)
User permissions are granted based on the established access group.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.IX Header "EXAMPLES"
Probably the simplest useful example of a complete \fIreaders.conf\fR,
this gives permissions to read and post to all groups to any connections
from the \*(L"example.com\*(R" domain, and no privileges for anyone connecting
elsewhere:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    auth example.com {
\&        hosts: "*.example.com, example.com"
\&        default: <LOCAL>
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    access full {
\&        newsgroups: *
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Note that the access realm has no users: key and therefore applies to any
user identity.  The only available auth realm only matches hosts in the
\&\*(L"example.com\*(R" domain, though, so any connections from other hosts will be
rejected immediately.
.PP
If you have some systems that should only have read-only access to the
server, you can modify the example above slightly by adding an additional
auth and access group:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    auth lab {
\&        hosts: "*.lab.example.com"
\&        default: <LAB>
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    access lab {
\&        users: <LAB>
\&        read: *
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
If those are put in the file after the above example, they'll take
precedence (because they're later in the file) for any user coming from a
machine in the lab.example.com domain, everyone will only have read
access, not posting access.
.PP
Here's a similar example for a news server that accepts connections from
anywhere but requires the user to specify a username and password.  The
username and password are first checked against an external database of
usernames and passwords, and then against the system shadow password file:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    auth all {
\&        auth: "ckpasswd \-d /usr/local/news/db/newsusers"
\&        auth: "ckpasswd \-s"
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    access full {
\&        users: *
\&        newsgroups: *
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
When the user first connects, there are no res: keys and no default, so
they don't receive any valid identity and the connection won't match any
access groups (even ones with \f(CW\*(C`users: *\*(C'\fR).  Such users receive nothing
but authentication-required responses from nnrpd until they authenticate.
.PP
If they then later authenticate, the username and password are checked
first by running \fBckpasswd\fR with the \fB\-d\fR option for an external dbm
file of encrypted passwords, and then with the \fB\-s\fR option to check the
shadow password database (note that this option may require ckpasswd to
be setgid to a shadow group, and there are security considerations; see
\&\fIckpasswd\fR\|(8) for details).  If both of those fail, the user will continue
to have no identity; otherwise, an identity will be assigned (usually
the supplied username, perhaps with a domain appended, although an
authenticator technically can provide a completely different username
for the identity), and the access group will match, giving full access.
.PP
It may be educational to consider how to combine the above examples;
general groups always go first.  The order of the auth groups actually
doesn't matter, since the \*(L"hosts: example.com\*(R" one only matches
connections before username/password is sent, and the \*(L"auth: ckpasswd\*(R"
one only matches after; order would matter if either group applied to
both cases.  The order of the access groups in this case does matter,
provided the newsgroups: lines differ; the access group with no users:
line needs to be first, with the \*(L"users: <\s-1LOCAL\s0>\*(R" group after.
.PP
Here's a very complicated example.  This is for an organization that has
an internal hierarchy \*(L"example.*\*(R" only available to local shell users, who
are on machines where identd can be trusted.  Dialup users must provide a
username and password, which is then checked against \s-1RADIUS\s0.  Remote users
have to use a username and password that's checked against a database on
the news server.  Finally, the admin staff (users \*(L"joe\*(R" and \*(L"jane\*(R") can
post anywhere (including the \*(L"example.admin.*\*(R" groups that are read-only
for everyone else), and are exempted from the Perl filter.  For an
additional twist, posts from dialup users have their Sender: header
replaced by their authenticated identity.
.PP
Since this organization has some internal moderated newsgroups, the admin
staff can also post messages with Approved: headers, but other users
cannot.
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    auth default {
\&        auth: "ckpasswd \-f /usr/local/news/db/newsusers"
\&        default: <FAIL>
\&        default\-domain: example.com
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    auth shell {

\&    }
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    access dialup {
\&        users: *@dialup.example.com
\&        newsgroups: *,!example.*
\&        nnrpdauthsender: true
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    access other {
\&        users: "*@example.com, !<FAIL>@example.com"
\&        newsgroups: *,!example.*

.Ve
.PP
.Vb 4

\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Note the use of different domains to separate dialup from shell users
easily.  Another way to do that would be with key: parameters, but this
way provides slightly more intuitive identity strings.  Note also that the
fail access group catches not only failing connections from external users
but also failed authentication of shell and dialup users and dialup users
before they've authenticated.  The identity string given for, say, dialup
users before \s-1RADIUS\s0 authentication has been attempted matches both the
dialup access group and the fail access group, since it's
\&\*(L"<\s-1FAIL\s0>@dialup.example.com\*(R", but the fail group is last so it takes
precedence.
.PP
The shell auth group has an auth: parameter so that users joe and jane
can, if they choose, use username and password authentication to gain
their special privileges even if they're logged on as a different user on
the shell machines (or if ident isn't working).  When they first connect,
they'd have the default access for that user, but they could then send
\&\s-1AUTHINFO\s0 \s-1USER\s0 and \s-1AUTHINFO\s0 \s-1PASS\s0 (or \s-1AUTHINFO\s0 \s-1SIMPLE\s0) and get their
extended access.
.PP
Also note that if the users joe and jane are using their own accounts,
they get their special privileges regardless of how they connect, whether
the dialups, the shell machines, or even externally with a username and
password.
.PP
Finally, here's a very simple example of a configuration for a public
server for a particular hierarchy.
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    auth default {
\&        hosts: *
\&        default: <PUBLIC>
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    access default {
\&        users: <PUBLIC>
\&        newsgroups: example.*
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Notice that clients aren't allowed to read any other groups; this keeps
them from getting access to administrative groups or reading control
messages, just as a precaution.  When running a public server like this,
be aware that many public hierarchies will later be pulled down and
reinjected into the main Usenet, so it's highly recommended that you also
run a Perl or Python filter to reject any messages crossposted out of your
local hierarchy and any messages containing a Supersedes: header.  This
will keep messages posted to your public hierarchy from hurting any of the
rest of Usenet if they leak out.
.SH "SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS"
.IX Header "SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS"
In general, separate passwords should be used for \s-1NNTP\s0 wherever
possible; the \s-1NNTP\s0 protocol itself does not protect passwords from
casual interception, and many implementations (including this one) do
not \*(L"lock out\*(R" accounts or otherwise discourage password-guessing
attacks.  So it is best to ensure that a compromised password has
minimal effects.
.PP
Authentication using the \s-1AUTHINFO\s0 \s-1USER/PASS\s0 commands passes unencrypted
over the network.  Extreme caution should therefore be used especially
with system passwords (e.g. \f(CW\*(C`auth: ckpasswd \-s\*(C'\fR).  Passwords can be
protected by using \s-1NNTP\s0 over \s-1SSL\s0 or through ssh tunnels, and this usage
can be enforced by a well-considered server configuration that only
permits certain auth groups to be applied in certain cases.  Here are
some ideas:
.IP "\(bu" 4
To restrict connections on the standard nntp port (119) to use \s-1SSL\s0 for
some (or all) of the auth groups to match, use the require_ssl:
parameter.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If you consider your local network (but not the internet) secure, have
some auth groups with a restrictive hosts: parameter; they would go
above, with ones having global applicability below.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Consider running a \f(CW\*(C`nnrpd \-S\*(C'\fR (with \f(CW\*(C`\-D\*(C'\fR, or out of \*(L"super\-server\*(R"
like inetd) on the nntps port (563) for clients that support \s-1SSL\s0.  You
can use the require_ssl: parameter, or \f(CW\*(C`\-c\*(C'\fR to specify an alternate
\&\fIreaders.conf\fR if you want a substantially different configuration for
this case.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If you want to restrict an auth group to only match loopback connections
(for users running newsreaders on localhost or connecting via an ssh
tunnel), use the localaddress: parameter.
