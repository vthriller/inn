.TH INN.CONF 5
.SH NAME
inn.conf \- configuration data for InterNetNews programs
.SH DESCRIPTION
The file
.IR <PREFIX\ specified\ with\ \-\-prefix\ at\ configure>/etc/inn.conf
is used to determine various parameters.
The value of the INNCONF environment variable can be
used to specify another inn.conf file.
Blank lines and lines starting with a number sign (``#'') are ignored.
All other lines specify parameters that may be read, and should be of
the following form:
.RS
.nf
name : [optional whitespace] value
.fi
.RE
Everything after the whitespace and up to the end of the line is taken as
the value; multi-word values should not be put in quotes.
The case of names is significant \(em
.I server
is not the same as
.I Server
or
.IR SERVER .
.PP
Some parameters specified in the file may be overridden by environment
variables, and some file parameters may be used to mask real data, such
as when hiding a cluster of hosts behind a single electronic mail hostname.
If the same parameter is specified more than twice, the first one is
used for that parameter.
The term ``default'' means the case that the parameter is not defined in
inn.conf.
Some parameters take boolean value.  The value can be one of ``true'', ``yes''
or ``on'' to turn on, and can be one of ``false'', ``no'' or ``off'' to turn
off.  The case of those value is not significant.
The current set of parameters is as follows:
.TP
.I fromhost
This is the name of the host to use when building the From header line.
The default is the fully-qualified domain name of the local host.
The value of the FROMHOST environment variable, if it exists,
overrides this.
.TP
.I moderatormailer
This names the default machine that contains forwarding aliases for all
moderated groups.
It is only used if the
.IR moderators (5)
file doesn't exist, or if the group is not matched by that file.
The value is interpreted as a pattern match; see
.IR moderators (5).
The default value is unset.
.TP
.I organization
This specifies what to put in the Organization header if it is blank.
The value of the ORGANIZATION environment variable, if it exists,
overrides this.
The default value is unset.
.TP
.I pathhost
This specifies how to name the local site when building the Path header line.
The default is the fully-qualified domain name of the local host.
.TP
.I server
This specifies the name of the NNTP server, and if the server does not use UNIX
domain socket, articles passed by
.IR nnrpd (8)
are get through INET domain socket to this server.
.IR actsync (8),
.IR nntpget (8)
and
.IR getlist (8)
also use the server to get where to connect.
The value of the NNTPSERVER environment variable, if it exists, overrides this.
The default value is unset.
.TP
.I domain
This should be the domain name of the local host.
It should not have a leading period, and it should not be a full host address.
It is used only if the
.I GetFQDN
routine in
.IR libinn (3)
cannot get the fully-qualified domain name by using either the
.IR gethostname (2)
or
.IR gethostbyname (3)
calls.
The check is very simple; if either routine returns a name with a period
in it, then it is assumed to have the full domain name.
The default value is unset.
.TP
.I overviewmmap
If this is ``false'' then nnrpd, expire and makehistory will use regular file
access to access overviews and overview indices, otherwise it will
.IR mmap (2)
them.  Setting this to ``true''
will give better performance on most system, but some system do have problems
with
.IR mmap (2).
This is boolean value and the default value is ``true''.
.TP
.I storageapi
If this is true then all articles will be stored through storage api and
all articles are assumed to be stored through storage api.
This is boolean value and the default is ``false''.
To use storage api, you need to edit storage.conf to determine which method will
be used.
If storage api is used, any overview database will be stored as unified
overview which is needed if nnrpd will be used.
To specify which index is used for unified overview, you need to edit
.IR <pathetc\ in\ inn.conf>/overview.ctl .
If you run innd as a feeder only, you do not need overview.ctl.
.TP
.I maxforks
How many times to attempt a
.IR fork (2)
before giving up.
The default value is
.IR <MAX_FORKS\ in\ config.data> .
.TP
.I maxartsize
The maximum size article (in bytes) that will be accepted by the
server. ``0'' allows any size.
The default value is ``1000000''.
.TP
.I nicekids
If set to anything other than ``0'', all child processes will have
this
.IR nice (1)
value.
The default value is ``4''.
.TP
.I nicenewnews
If set to anything greater than ``0'', all
.IR nnrpd (8)
processes that use
the ``NEWNEWS'' command will
.IR nice (1)
themselves to this value. This gives other nnrpd processes a higher
priority. The default value is ``0'', which means
that no change is made from the ``nicekids'' value. Note that this
value will be ignored if it is set to a value lower than ``nicekids''.
.TP
.I mta
This specifies the message transfer agent (mta) to be used when mailing
moderated postings and for use for innmail. The article, with headers and
an added To: line, will be piped into this program and an optional ``%s''
parameter will be replaced with the moderator email address(es). See
.IR moderators (5)
for more info on the moderator email address(es). The ``mta'' option
is compulsory.
The default value is unset, but this will note fatal error through syslog.
This must be set.
.TP
.I mailcmd
This is the path/program to be used for mailing reports and control
messages. The default path is pathbin/innmail.
.TP
.I verifycancels
Set this to ``true'' to verify that a poster is the person doing the cancel.
This can't be done if the cancel arrives before the article does.
This is boolean value and the default is ``false''.
.TP
.I logcancelcomm
Set this to ``true'' to log ``ctlinnd cancel'' commands to syslog.
This is boolean value and the default is ``false''.
.TP
.I wanttrash
Set this to ``true'' if you want to file articles in unknown newsgroups
into the ``junk'' newsgroup.
This is boolean value and the default is ``false''.
.TP
.I remembertrash
Set this to ``false'' if you don't want to record rejected articles in
history. This might cause duplicate articles to be offered to you,
so be careful with it.
This is boolean value and the default is ``false''.
.TP
.I linecountfuzz
If this number is set to any number other than ``0'', the article
linecounts are checked against the Lines: header and the header is
adjusted if it is out by more than this amount. A suitable figure
is ``5'' which is the number of suitable .signature lines + 1.
The default value is ``0''.
.TP
.I logartsize
Should the article size be put into the article log file. This is
useful for statistics.
This is boolean value and the default is ``true''.
.TP
.I logipaddr
Should the IP address of a host be logged rather than the entry in
the Path: line. This is useful for tracking forged postings.
This is boolean value and the default is ``true''.
.TP
.I logsitename
Should the site names be put into the article log file.  Those names
are used by
.IR newsrequeue (8).
This is boolean value and the default is ``true''.
.TP
.I overviewname
What file name to use for storing overview data. Defaults to
``.overview''.
.TP
.I extendeddbz
Should overview offset be put into dbz file.
This can be useful to gain overview performance, but note that dbz
file size will be three times.
Whenever
.I extendeddbz
is changed, dbz files should be rebuilt with
.IR makehistory (8)
like this.
.sp 1
.nf
.in +0.5i
makehistory -r -s `cat history | wc -l` -f history
.in -0.5i
.fi
.sp 1
If 
.I storageapi
is ``false'', 
.I extendeddbz
is ignored and always treated as ``false''.
.I extendeddbz
is available only if
.IR <DBZ_TAGGED_HASH\ in\ config.data>
is ``DONT''.
This is boolean value and the default is ``false''.
.TP
.I nnrpdoverstats
Should nnrpd overview statistics report be logged to syslog.
This can be useful to see overview performance.
This is boolean value and the default is ``false''.
.TP
.I storeonxref
Should storage api stores articles based on newsgroup name in Xref header.
If this is ``false'', it stores articles based on newsgroup name in
Newsgroups header.
This is boolean value and the default is ``true''.
.TP
.I nnrpdcheckart
Should nnrpd check the existense of article before responding nntp command.
This can be useful, if article are gone but their overview data still exist.
This is boolean value and the default is ``true''.
.TP
.I storemsgid
Should history store Message-ID in
.IR history (5),
not HASH format.
.I storemsgid
is available, if
.I storageapi
is ``false''.
This is boolean value and the default is ``true''.
.TP
.I usecontrolchan
Should use channel for control messages except cancel.
You need to set up controlchan in newsfeeds and ensure ``control.cancel''
exists in active, if this is set to ``true''.
This is boolean value and the default is ``false''.
.TP
.I mergetogroups
Should merge ``to.*'' groups into ``to''.
You need to ensure ``to''
exists in active, if this is set to ``true''.
This is boolean value and the default is ``false''.
.TP
.I keywords
Should keywords be generated in the overview databases. Must be a boolean
value.
This is boolean value and the default is ``false''.
Changing this requires also changing
.IR <pathetc\ in\ inn.conf>/overview.fmt
and removing the existing overview database.
.I keywords
is available only if
.IR <KEYWORDS\ in\ config.data>
is ``DO''.
.TP
.I keylimit
Maximum number of bytes allocated internally for building keyword data.
The default value is ``512''.
.TP
.I keyartlimit
Maximum size of a an article that will have keywords generated for it.
The default value is ``100000''.
.TP
.I keymaxwords
Maximum number of keywords that will be generated for an article.
The default value is ``250''.
.TP
.I refusecybercancels
Refuse articles that start with a Message-ID: of ``<cancel.''. This
refusal is done before the history check and the ID is not written
to the history file. The preferred way to do this is to ask your
upstream feeder to alias out ``cyberspam'' in the newsfeed to you.
This can also be done using the ``filter_messageid'' perl hook
if perl filtering is turned on, in which case this option can be
set to ``false''.
This is boolean value and the default is ``false''.
.TP
.I activedenable
If set to ``true'' then
.IR nnrpd (8)
processes access the active file through a separate process, using
UDP requests. The actived process will be started automatically on
innd startup. This saves a significant amount of memory and processing
time for news readers, particularly on startup.
This is boolean value and the default is ``false''.
.TP
.I activedupdate
This is the interval (in seconds) that actived updates its in-memory
copy of the active file.
.TP
.I activedport
The UDP port on which to send actived requests and responses.
.TP
.I noreader
If set to ``false'' innd will fork a copy of nnrpd for all connections from
hosts not mentioned in incoming.conf. You probably want to set this to ``true''
if you run a transit only server, or serve nnrpd from inetd or daemon mode.
This is a boolean value and the default is ``false''.
.TP
.I pathnews
The news user home directory and sometimes the root of the news
hierarchy.
The default value is unset, but this will note fatal error through syslog.
.TP
.I pathbin
The path to the news binaries.
The default value is ``<pathnews>/bin''.
.TP
.I pathfilter
The path to the perl and TCL filters
The default value is ``<pathnews>/filter''.
.TP
.I pathcontrol
The path to the news control files. The files in this directory represent
the commands that will be executed based on the Control: line in
news articles. Be careful what you put in here, as it can become a
security risk.
The default value is ``<pathnews>/control''.
.TP
.I pathdb
The path to the database files used and changed by the server. Files
currently in this directory are: active, history* and newsgroups.
Historically, this defaulted to pathetc, but is not split.
The default value is ``<pathnews>/db''.
.TP
.I pathetc
The news configuration files.
The default value is ``<pathnews>/etc''.
.TP
.I pathrun
Files required while the server is running. This includes locks and
the channel socket.
The default value is ``<pathnews>/run''.
.TP
.I pathlog
Where the news log files are written.
The default value is ``<pathnews>/log''.
.TP
.I pathhttp
Where to place any HTML files (e.g: status report).
The default value is ``<pathlog>''.
.TP
.I pathtmp
Where the various programs place their tempfiles. For security reasons
this is not the same as the system temporary files directory.
The default value is
.IR ``<PATH\ specified\ with\ \-\-with\-tmp\-path\ at\ configure>''.
.TP
.I pathspool
The root of the news spool hierarchy. This isn't actually used at
the moment.
The default value is ``<pathnews>/spool''.
.TP
.I patharticles
Path where the news articles are stored.
The default value is ``<pathspool>/spool''.
.TP
.I pathoverview
Path to news overview files. Can be set to the same as ``patharticles''
if ``overviewname'' is set to something sensible.
The default value is ``<pathspool>/overview''.
.TP
.I pathoutgoing
Default path for outgoing feed files.
The default value is ``<pathspool>/outgoing''.
.TP
.I pathincoming
Path where incoming batched news is stored.
The default value is ``<pathspool>/incoming''.
.TP
.I patharchive
A path to store archived news.
The default value is ``<pathspool>/archive''.
.PP
.TP
.I pathuniover
A path to unified overview files.
The default value is ``<pathspool>/uniover''.
.PP
The following parameters are used only by 
.IR nnrpd (8)
to control high-volume posters via an exponential backoff algorithm.
These parameters are read at 
.IR nnrpd (8)
run time.
.PP
Exponential posting backoff works as follows. News clients are 
indexed by IP number (or username, see 
.I backoffauth 
below). Each time that a specific IP number posts a message, the time of
posting is stored (along with the previous sleep time, see below). 
After a configurable number of posts in a configurable period of time,
.IR nnrpd (8)
will activate posting backoff, and begin to sleep for increasing
periods of time before actually posting anything. Posts will still get
through, but at an increasingly reduced rate.
.PP
The new sleep time is computed based on the difference in time between
the last posting and the current posting, assuming that backoff has
been activated.
.PP
If this difference is less than 
.I backoffpostfast
, the new sleep time will be 1 + (previous sleep time * 
.I backoffk
). 
.PP
If this difference is less than 
.I backoffpostslow,
but greater than 
.I backoffpostfast,
then the new sleep time will equal the previous sleep time.
.PP
If this difference is greater than 
.I backoffpostslow
then the new sleep time is zero and the number of postings for this IP
number is reset to zero.
.PP
Here are the parameters that control exponential posting
backoff:
.TP
.I backoffk
An integer value representing the amount to multiply the previous
sleep time by. A value of 2 works to double the
sleep time for each excessive post. 
The default value is ``1''.
.TP
.I backoffpostfast
Postings from the same IP which arrive in less than this amount of
time (in seconds) will trigger increasing sleeptime in the backoff
algorithm.
The default value is ``0''.
.TP
.I backoffpostslow
Postings from the same IP which arrive in greater than this amount of
time (in seconds) will reset the backoff algorithm.
Another way to look at this constant is to compute 86400/
.I backoffpostslow
which will give you the maximum number of articles per day that you will allow
users to post.
The default value is ``1''.
.TP
.I backofftrigger
This many postings are allowed before the backoff algorithm is
triggered.
The default value is ``10000''.
.TP
.I backoffdb
Pathname to a directory (must be writable by news) that is to contain
the backoff database. There is no default for this parameter, you must
provide an existing and writable pathname value or users will not be
able to post.
The default value is unset.
.TP 
.I backoffauth
This is a boolean value. If on, posting backoffs are indexed on a per
user basis instead of a per IP basis. You must be using authentication
in 
.IR nnrpd (8)
for the ``true'' value of this parameter to have any meaning.
This is boolean value and the default is ``false''.
.TP
.I readertrack
This is a boolean value. If on, the article tracking system is
enabled for client reading/posting. See the
.IR nnrpd.track (5)
man page for details.
This is boolean value and the default is ``false''.
.TP
.I strippostcc
This is a boolean value. If on, To:, Cc: and Bcc: lines are stripped from
local posts through
.IR nnrpd (8).
This is aimed mainly at stopping abuse of posting
to moderated newsgroups, whereby those headers are added by the client
and honoured by the mailer when mailed to the moderator.
This is boolean value and the default is ``false''.
.TP
.I nnrpperlauth
This enables
.IR nnrpd (8)
to authenticate reader with external perl hook.
If this is enabled, normal authentication with
.IR nnrp.access (5)
will not be used.
This is boolean value and the default is ``false''.
.PP
The following parameters are used only by
.I innd.
.TP
.I pathalias
This specifies the name prepended before pathhost, if it is not appeared
in the Path header line.
If this is not specified, nothing is prepended before pathhost.
The default value is unset.
.TP
.I hiscachesize
If this is set to a non-zero number then history file lookups are cached.
This number is the amount of memory to dedicate to the lookup cache in 
kilobytes.  It is generally useful to have memory allocated to history
cache if dbz mmaping is turned on.
The default value is ``0''.
.TP
.I xrefslave
If this is true, innd will use the information in the Xref:
header for replication.  And if this is true,
.I nnrpdposthost
should be set to hand articles to the master server.
This is boolean value and the default is ``false''.
.TP
.I nnrpdposthost
If this is specified,
.IR nnrpd (8)
and
.I rnews
pass articles to the specified host.
This should be set, if
.I xrefslave
is ``true''.
The default value is unset.
.TP
.I wireformat
If this is true then innd will write articles in wire format.  Wire format
articles are stored with a \\r\\n at the end of each line and with periods
at the beginning of lines doubled.  When used with applications that understand
wire format, this can be considerably more efficent.
If 
.I storageapi
is ``true'', 
.I wireformat
is discarded and articles are always stored in wire format.
This is boolean value and the default is ``false''.
.TP
.I writelinks
If this is true innd will write all the crossposts of an article to
the history file, else it will write just the first.  This can be
useful on servers without readers that don't run crosspost and don't
link crossposts.
If 
.I storageapi
is ``true'', 
.I writelinks
is discarded.
This is boolean value and the default is ``true''.
.TP
.I status
If this is '0' or 'false', then status monitoring will be disabled by
default.  Otherwise, it would be how often to report status
statistics, in seconds.  If turned on statistics will be logged to syslog.
The default value is ``0''.
.TP
.I timer
If this is '0' or 'false', then performance monitoring will be disabled by
default.  Otherwise, it would be how often to report performance
statistics, in seconds.  If turned on statistics will be logged to syslog.
The default value is ``0''.
.TP
.I peertimeout
How long (in seconds) an innd incoming channel can be inactive before
innd closes the channel.
The default value is ``3600''.
.TP
.I readerswhenstopped
Allow readers to connect even when the server is paused or throttled.
This is boolean value and the default is ``false''.
.TP
.I allownewnews
Allow use of the ``NEWNEWS'' command by clients. Allowing this can be
a performance problem on the server, but is recommended by RFC 977.
This is boolean value and the default is ``true''.
.TP
.I chaninacttime
The time (in seconds) to wait between noticing inactive channels.
The default value is ``600''.
.TP
.I chanretrytime
How many seconds to wait before a channel restarts.
The default value is ``300''.
.TP
.I maxconnections
The maximum number of incoming NNTP connections.
The default value is ``50''.
.TP
.I artcutoff
Articles older than this number of days are dropped.
The default value is 14 days.
.TP
.I nntplinklog
Should we put nntplink info (filename) into the log.
This is boolean value and the default is ``false''.
.TP
.I nntpactsync
How many articles to process before logging NNTP activity.
The default value is ``200''.
.TP
.I badiocount
How many read/write failures until a channel is put to sleep or closed.
The default value is ``5''.
.TP
.I pauseretrytime
Wait for this many seconds between noticing inactive channels.
The default value is ``300''.
.TP
.I blockbackoff
A multiplier (in seconds) for sleep in ``EWOULDBLOCK'' writes.
The default value is ``120''.
.TP
.I icdsynccount
How many article writes between active and history file updates.
The default value is ``10''.
.TP
.I bindaddress
Which interface IP address
.I innd
should bind to. Must be in dotted-quad format (nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn).
If set to ``all'' or not set at all,
.I innd
defaults to listening on all interfaces.
The value of the INND_BIND_ADDRESS environment variable, if it exists,
overrides this.
The default value is unset.
.TP
.I sourceaddress
Which local IP address to bind for outgoing NNTP sockets (used by
.I innxmit
among possibly others). Must be in dotted-quad format (nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn)
If set to ``all'' or not set at all, the operating system which choose
the source IP address for outgoing NNTP connections.
The default value is unset.
.TP
.I port
Which TCP port
.I innd
should listen on.
The default value is ``119'' - the standard nntp port.
.PP
The following parameters are used only by
.IR nnrpd (8)
( or perhaps
.I inews )
when accepting postings from clients:
.TP
.I checkincludedtext
If set to ``true'' then local postings must have under  50% inclusion
(">") lines.
This is boolean value and the default is ``false''.
.TP
.I localmaxartsize
The maximum article size (in bytes) for locally posted articles.
The default value is ``1000000''.
.TP
.I mimeversion
If this parameter is present, then
.IR nnrpd (8)
will add the necessary MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
headers to all any articles that do not have a Mime-Version header.
This parameter specifies the MIME version, and should normally be ``1.0''.
The default value is unset.
.TP
.I mimecontenttype
If MIME headers are being added, this parameter specifies the value
of the Content-Type header.
The default value is ``text/plain; charset=US-ASCII.''
.TP
.I mimeencoding
If MIME headers are being added, this parameter specifies the value of
the Content-Transfer-Encoding header.
The default value is ``7bit.''
.TP
.I spoolfirst
If this is true then nnrpd will spool new articles with out attempting
to send them to innd first.  If this is false then nnrpd will spool
new articles only after receiving an error trying to send them to
innd.  Setting this to true can be useful if you want nnrpd to
respond to the client as fast as possible, however, nnrpd will not
report articles that are not accepted by innd to the client if they
are spool.
This is boolean value and the default is ``false''.
.TP
.I complaints
If this is set, then it contains the value of the X-Complaints-To:
header that will be added to all posts.  If not, then this defaults to
the newsmaster's e-mail address.
.TP
.I articlemmap
If this is false then nnrpd will use regular file access to access 
articles, otherwise it will mmap() the articles.  Setting this to true
will give better performance on most systems, but some systems do have 
problems with mmap().
This is boolean value and the default is ``false''.
.TP
.I clienttimeout
How long (in seconds) an nnrpd can be inactive before it exits.
The default value is ``600''.
.PP
The following flags are only used by the startup script ``rc.news''.
.TP
.I decnetdomain
.PP
Use this value as the domain to be used for clients connecting via DECNET.
Support for this is only compiled into INN if ``AF_DECnet'' is defined
and compile time.
The default value is unset.
.TP
.I innflags
The flags to pass to INN on startup. See the
.IR innd (8)
man page for details.
The default value is unset.
.TP
.I doinnwatch
If set to ``false'' then do not start
.IR innwatch (8).
This is boolean value and the default is ``true''.
.TP
.I innwatchsleeptime
How long (in seconds) an innwatch will be sleep before it checks.
The default value is ``600''.
.TP
.I pgpverify
If set to ``true'' then enables pgp verification for handling control
messages except cancel.
This is boolean value and the default is ``false''.
.TP
.I controlfailnotice
If set to ``true'' and
.I usecontrolchan
is set to ``false'', then if there is a problem processing control message,
it is reported to the administrator through mail.  If set to ``false'' or
.I usecontrolchan
is set to ``true'', nothing is reported.
This is boolean value and the default is ``false''.
.TP
.I logcycles
How many logs does
.IR news.daily (8)
(
.IR scanlogs (8)
) keep before it overwrites.
The default value is ``3''.
.TP
.I innwatchpauseload
Load average (* 100) at which innd should be paused by
