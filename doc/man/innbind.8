.IX Title "INNBIND 8"
.TH INNBIND 8 "2003-04-16" "INN 2.5.0" "InterNetNews Documentation"
.SH "NAME"
innbind \- Helper program to bind sockets to privileged ports
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBinnbind\fR \fIfd\fR,\fIfamily\fR,\fIaddress\fR,\fIport\fR [...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBinnbind\fR is a helper program that's not meant to be run directly.
Instead, \fBinnd\fR and \fBnnrpd\fR use it internally to bind to ports that
require root privileges to bind to.
.PP
This program must be installed setuid root in order for \fBinnd\fR or
\&\fBnnrpd\fR to bind to ports under 1024.  The only function that it's willing
to perform is to bind an open file descriptor to a given address and port.
It can only be run as the news user (as specified at configure time), and
will only bind to ports 119, 433, an additional port specified with the
\&\fB\-\-with\-innd\-port\fR argument to configure, or ports numbered 1024 or
higher.
.PP
Each argument to \fBinnbind\fR must be a comma-separated list of four
elements.  The first is the file descriptor number that should be bound,
the second is the numeric family of the socket (\s-1AF_INET\s0 or \s-1AF_INET6\s0), the
third is the local address to bind to (in dotted quad format for IPv4 and
in colon-separated address format for IPv6), and the fourth is the port
number.  To bind to all addresses with IPv4, use \f(CW0.0.0.0\fR as the
address.  To bind to all addresses with IPv6, use \f(CW\*(C`::\*(C'\fR as the address.
.PP
Multiple arguments can be specified to tell \fBinnbind\fR to bind multiple
sockets at the same time.  Any errors encountered will cause \fBinnbind\fR to
abort, and error messages will be sent both to syslog and to standard
error.
.SH "SECURITY"
.IX Header "SECURITY"
As \fBinnbind\fR is normally installed setuid root, security is even more of
an issue for it than for other parts of \s-1INN\s0.  It is a fairly short
program, and if you understand C, you are encouraged to audit it yourself
to be certain that it does only what it is supposed to do.
.PP
The ports that will be bound are restricted to prevent potential attacks
made possible by the ability to bind low-numbered ports, such as exploits
of the \fIrsh\fR\|(1) family of commands on some systems.  If \fBinnbind\fR is
installed setuid root, it can only be executed by the news user to prevent
other users on the system from being able to bind to even those few
privileged ports that it allows.
.PP
\&\fBinnbind\fR uses no external configuration files; the only files it might
open are through the system \fIgetpwnam\fR\|(3) service to get the \s-1UID\s0 of the news
user.  The only user input that it accepts are its command-line arguments.
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.IX Header "DIAGNOSTICS"
\&\fBinnbind\fR may log the following messages to syslog and print them to
standard error.
.ie n .IP "cannot bind socket for %s:\fR \f(CW%s" 4
.el .IP "cannot bind socket for \f(CW%s:\fR \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "cannot bind socket for %s: %s"
(Fatal) Calling bind for the socket corresponding to the given argument
failed with a system error.  This can be caused by trying to use IPv6 on
a system whose kernel does not support it.
.ie n .IP "cannot bind to restricted port %hu\fR in \f(CW%s" 4
.el .IP "cannot bind to restricted port \f(CW%hu\fR in \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "cannot bind to restricted port %hu in %s"
(Fatal) The port number portion of the given command-line argument is for
a port below 1024 which is not 119, 433, or a port given to
\&\fB\-\-with\-innd\-port\fR at configure time.  Other ports are not allowed for
security reasons.
.ie n .IP "cannot get socket options for file descriptor %d:\fR \f(CW%s" 4
.el .IP "cannot get socket options for file descriptor \f(CW%d:\fR \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "cannot get socket options for file descriptor %d: %s"
(Fatal) \fBinnbind\fR was unable to get the socket options for that file
descriptor.  The most likely cause of this error is passing the wrong file
descriptor number to \fBinnbind\fR (a file descriptor that isn't open, or
that corresponds to a regular file rather than a network socket).
.ie n .IP "cannot get \s-1UID\s0 for %s" 4
.el .IP "cannot get \s-1UID\s0 for \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "cannot get UID for %s"
(Fatal) \fBinnbind\fR was unable to get the \s-1UID\s0 for the news user specified
during configure (and defaulting to \f(CW\*(C`news\*(C'\fR).  This normally means that
user isn't in the system passwd file.
.ie n .IP "invalid file descriptor %d: not \s-1SOCK_STREAM\s0" 4
.el .IP "invalid file descriptor \f(CW%d:\fR not \s-1SOCK_STREAM\s0" 4
.IX Item "invalid file descriptor %d: not SOCK_STREAM"
(Fatal) The given file descriptor is not a \s-1SOCK_STREAM\s0 socket.  \fBinnbind\fR
can only bind \s-1SOCK_STREAM\s0 sockets.
.ie n .IP "invalid IPv4 address %s\fR in \f(CW%s" 4
.el .IP "invalid IPv4 address \f(CW%s\fR in \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "invalid IPv4 address %s in %s"
(Fatal) The IPv4 address specified in the given command-line option could
not be parsed by \fIinet_aton\fR\|(3).  IPv4 addresses should be specified in the
standard dotted quad format (10.2.3.4).
.ie n .IP "invalid IPv6 address %s\fR in \f(CW%s" 4
.el .IP "invalid IPv6 address \f(CW%s\fR in \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "invalid IPv6 address %s in %s"
(Fatal) The IPv6 address specified in the given command-line option could
not be parsed by \fIinet_pton\fR\|(3).  IPv6 addresses should be specified in \s-1RFC\s0
2373 format (1080:0:0:0:8:800:200C:417A or 1080::8:800:200C:417A).
.ie n .IP "invalid command-line argument %s" 4
.el .IP "invalid command-line argument \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "invalid command-line argument %s"
(Fatal) The specified command-line argument could not be parsed or was not
in the correct format.
.ie n .IP "invalid file descriptor %s\fR in \f(CW%s" 4
.el .IP "invalid file descriptor \f(CW%s\fR in \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "invalid file descriptor %s in %s"
(Fatal) The file descriptor portion of the given command-line argument is
not a non-negative integer.
.ie n .IP "invalid port number %s\fR in \f(CW%s" 4
.el .IP "invalid port number \f(CW%s\fR in \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "invalid port number %s in %s"
(Fatal) The port number portion of the given command-line argument is not
a non-negative integer.
.ie n .IP "invalid protocol family %s\fR in \f(CW%s" 4
.el .IP "invalid protocol family \f(CW%s\fR in \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "invalid protocol family %s in %s"
(Fatal) The protocol family portion of the given command-line argument is
not a non-negative integer.  It should be equal to either \s-1AF_INET\s0 or
\&\s-1AF_INET6\s0 on the system where \fBinnbind\fR is run.
.ie n .IP "must be run by user %s\fR (%lu), not \f(CW%lu" 4
.el .IP "must be run by user \f(CW%s\fR (%lu), not \f(CW%lu\fR" 4
.IX Item "must be run by user %s (%lu), not %lu"
(Fatal) When setuid root, \fBinnbind\fR may only be run by the news user as
specified at configure time (\f(CW\*(C`news\*(C'\fR by default), for security reasons.
.ie n .IP "unknown protocol family %s\fR in \f(CW%s" 4
.el .IP "unknown protocol family \f(CW%s\fR in \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "unknown protocol family %s in %s"
(Fatal) The protocol number portion of the given command-line argument is
neither \s-1AF_INET\s0 nor \s-1AF_INET6\s0.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.IX Header "EXAMPLES"
As mentioned above, \fBinnbind\fR is never run directly, only by \fBinnd\fR and
other programs that need to bind to and listen to network ports.  Sample
invocations by \fBinnd\fR would be:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    innbind 3,10,::,119
.Ve
.PP
to bind the IPv6 socket on file descriptor 3 to port 119, all addresses,
or:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    innbind 6,2,10.0.0.3,433
.Ve
.PP
to bind the IPv4 socket on file descriptor 6 to port 433 in the address
10.0.0.3.
