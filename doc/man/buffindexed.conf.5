.TH BUFFINDEXED.CONF 5
.SH NAME
buffindexed.conf \- configuration file for buffindexed ovmethod
.SH DESCRIPTION
The file
.I <pathetc in inn.conf>/buffindexed.conf
is required if buffindexed ovmethod is used.
Buffindexed is one of ovmethod which is specified in
.IR inn.conf (5).
.PP
The file consists of a series of lines;
blank lines and lines beginning with a number sign (``#'') are ignored.
There is only one kind of configuration line.
The order of lines in this file is not important.

\&``Index'' is an index of overview buffer.
\&``Index'' must be between 0 and 65535.
\&``File_name'' is the path to overview buffer file.
The length of this path should be within 63 letters.
\&``Buffer_size'' is the length of buffer file in kilobytes
in decimal (1KB = 1024 bytes).  If the ``file_name'' is not a special
device, the file must be buffer_size * 1024 bytes.
.PP
To create new overview buffer, there are two different methods for creating
the files.
.TP
.BR 1. " Create a big file on top of a standard filesystem."
The use "dd" to create the overview buffer
files, such as "dd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/ovbuff bs=1024 count=N"
where N is the buffer_size.
.TP
.BR 2. " Use block disk devices directly."
If your operating system will allow you to
.I mmap()
block disk devices (Solaris does, FreeBSD does not), this is the
recommended method.  Partition the disks to make each partition
slightly larger (a few MB larger) than the intended size of each overview buffer.
It is not recommend to use the block device files already located in ``/dev.''
Instead, use "mknod" to create a new set of block device files.
In order to do this, do an "ls -l" of the /dev/dsk partition and then a
subsequent "ls -l" of the destination of the symbolic link under /devices.
The major and minor device numbers are in the fifth and sixth columns (right
before the date) respectively.  This information should be fed to "mknod"
to make a "block-type special file" (b).
Here is a short script that accomplishes this when fed the /dev/dsk/
partition name:
.sp 1
.nf
.in +0.5i
#!/bin/sh
disk=$1
link=`ls -l /dev/dsk/$disk | awk '{print $11}'`
major=`ls -l /dev/dsk/$link | awk '{print $5}' | tr -d ,`
minor=`ls -l /dev/dsk/$link | awk '{print $6}`
mkdir /ovbuff
mknod /ovbuff/$disk b $major $minor
.in -0.5i
.fi
The created device files themselves consume very little space.
.PP
In either case, make certain that each overview buffer file is owned by your
news user, news group, and has rw modes for the owner and group (mode
0664 or 0660).
.PP
When you first start innd and everything is configured properly, you
should see messages in news.notice which look like:
.sp 1   
.nf
.in +0.5i
