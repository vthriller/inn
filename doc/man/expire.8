.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Expire
scans the
.IR history (5)
text file
.\" =()<.I @<_PATH_HISTORY>@>()=
.I /var/news/etc/history
and uses the information recorded in it to purge old news articles.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-d
If the ``\fP\-d\fP'' flag is used, then the new history file and database is
created in the specified directory,
.IR dir .
This is useful when the filesystem does not have sufficient space to
hold both the old and new history files.
When this flag is used,
.I expire
leaves the server paused and creates a zero-length file named after the
new history file, with an extension of ``.done'' to indicate that
it has successfully completed the expiration.
The calling script should install the new history file and un-pause the server.
The ``\fB\-r\fP'' flag should be used with this flag.
.TP
.B \-e
If the ``\fP\-e\fP'' flag is used, then as soon as the first cross posting 
of the article expires, all copies of it are removed.
.TP
.B \-f
To specify an alternate history file, use the ``\fB\-f\fP'' flag.
.TP
.B \-g
If the ``\fP\-g\fP'' flag is given, then a one-line summary equivalent to the
output of ``\fP\-v\fP1'' and preceeded by the current time, will be appended to
the specified
.IR file .
.TP
.B \-h
To specify an alternate input text history file, use the ``\fB\-h\fP'' flag.
.I Expire
uses the old
.IR dbz (3z)
database to determine the size of the new one.
.TP
.B \-i
To ignore the old database, use the ``\fB\-i\fP'' flag.
.TP
.B \-k
If this flag is used then articles are removed when they have been
expired from all the groups they appear in.  This is intended for use
on news spools that are on a single filesystem and/or with the time
based spool. (See inn.conf(5))
.TP
.B \-l
.I Expire
normally just unlinks each file if it should be expired.
If the ``\fB\-l\fP'' flag is used, then all articles after the first one are
treated as if they could be symbolic links to the first one.
In this case, the first article will not be removed as long as any other
cross-posts of the article remain.
.TP
.B \-n
If
.I innd
is not running, use the ``\fB\-n\fP'' flag and
.I expire
will not send the ``pause'' or ``go'' commands.
(For more details on the commands, see
.IR ctlinnd (8)).
Note that
.I expire
only needs exclusive access for a very short time \(em long enough to see
if any new articles arrived since it first hit the end of the file, and to
rename the new files to the working files.
.TP
.B \-p
.I Expire
makes its decisions on the time the article arrived, as found in the
.I history
file.
This means articles are often kept a little longer than with other
expiration programs that base their decisions on the article's posting
date.
To use the article's posting date, use the ``\fP\-p\fP'' flag.
.TP
.B \-q
.I Expire
normally complains about articles that are posted to newsgroups not
mentioned in the active file.
To suppress this action, use the ``\fB\-q\fP'' flag.
.TP
.B \-r
.I Expire
normally sends a ``pause'' command to the local
.IR innd (8)
daemon when it needs exclusive access to the history file, using
the string ``Expiring'' as the reason.
To give a different reason, use the ``\fB\-r\fP'' flag.
The process ID will be appended to the reason.
When
.I expire
is finished and the new history file is ready, it sends a ``go'' command.
.TP
.B \-s
If the ``\fB\-s\fP'' flag is used, then
.I expire
will print a summary when it exits showing the approximate number of
kilobytes used by all deleted articles.
.TP
.B \-t
If the ``\fB\-t\fP'' flag is used, then
.I expire
will generate a list of the files that should be removed on its
standard output, and the new history file will be left in
.I history.n
and
.I history.n.dir
,
.I history.n.index
.IR history.n.hash .
This flag be useful for debugging when used with the ``\fB\-n\fP'' and
``\fB\-s\fP'' flags.  Note that if the ``\fB\-f\fP'' flag is used, then the
name specified with that flag will be used instead of
.IR history .
.TP
.B \-v
The ``\fB\-v\fP'' flag is used to increase the verbosity of the program,
generating messages to standard output.
The
.I level
should be a number, where higher numbers result in more output.
Level one will print totals of the various actions done (not valid if a
new history file is not written), level two will print report on each
individual file, while level five results in more than one line of output
for every line processed.
.TP
.B \-w
Use the ``\fP\-w\fP'' flag to ``warp'' time so that
.I expire
thinks it is running at some time other then the current time.
The value should be a signed floating point number of the number of days
to use as the offset.
.TP
.B \-x
If the ``\fB\-x\fP'' flag is used, then
.I expire
will not create any new history files.  This is most useful when combined
with the ``\fB\-n\fP'', `\fB`\-s\fP'', and `\fB`\-t\fP'' flags to see how
different expiration policies would change the amount of disk space used.
.TP
.B \-z
If the ``\fB\-z\fP'' flag is used, then articles are not removed, but their
names are appended to the specified
.IR file .
See the description of
.I expirerm
in
.IR news.daily (8).
.PP
If a filename is specified, it is taken as the control file and parsed
according to the rules in
.IR expire.ctl (5).
A single dash (``\-'') may be used to read the file from standard input.
If no file is specified, the file
.\" =()<.IR @<_PATH_EXPIRECTL>@>()=
.IR /var/news/etc/expire.ctl
is read.
