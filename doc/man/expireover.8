.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Expireover
expires entries from the news overview database.
It reads a list of newsgroup list (
.IR <pathdb\ in\ inn.conf>/active ).
(A file name of ``\-'' may be used to specify the standard input.)
It then removes any mention of those articles from the appropriate overview
database.
If ``groupbaseexpiry'' in
.I inn.conf
is ``true'',
.I expireover
also expires articles.  If it's ``false'', ``\fI\-e\fP'', ``\fI\-k\fP'',
\&``\fI\-N\fP'', ``\fI\-p\fP'', ``\fI\-q\fP'', ``\fI\-w\fP'' and ``\fI\-z\fP''
flags are ignored.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-e
If the ``\fI\-e\fP'' flag is used, then as soon as the first cross posting
of the article expires, all overview entries relevant to the article are
removed.
Note that you cannot use both ``\fI\-e\fP'' and ``\fI\-k\fP'' flag at the
same time.
.TP
.B \-f
When the ``\fB\-\fPs'' flag is used, then
.I expireover
will use it as newsgroup list instead of
.IR active (5)
file.
To specify an alternate file, use the ``\fB\-f\fP'' flag; a name 
of ``\fB\-\fP'' is
taken to mean the standard input.
.TP
.B \-k
If this flag is used then articles are removed when they have been 
expired from all the groups they appear in.
Note that you cannot use both ``\fI\-e\fP'' and ``\fI\-k\fP'' flag at the
same time.
.TP
.B \-N 
If the storing method has self expire functionality, then the control file
is ignored for that article by default.
If the ``\fB\-N\fP'' flag is used,
.I expireover
purges articles and overview entries with the control file.
.TP 
.B \-p
.I Expireover
makes its decisions on the time the article arrived.
This means articles are often kept a little longer than with other
expiration programs that base their decisions on the article's posting
date.
To use the article's posting date, use the ``\fI\-p\fP'' flag.
.TP
.B \-q 
.I Expireover
normally prints statistics at the end of process.
To suppress this action, use the ``\fB\-q\fP'' flag.
.TP
.B \-w
Use the ``\fI\-w\fP'' flag to ``warp'' time so that
.I expireover
thinks it is running at some time other then the current time.
The value should be a signed floating point number of the number of days
to use as the offset.
.TP 
.B \-z
If the ``\fB\-z\fP'' flag is used, then articles are not removed, but their
names are appended to the specified
.IR file .
See the description of
.I delayrm
in 
.IR news.daily (8).
.TP
.B \-Z
If the ``\fB\-Z\fP'' flag is used, then the lowest article numbers for
each newsgroup are written to the specified file.
This flag can be usable when doing ``ctlinnd lomark lofile''.
