<title>Welcome to INN 2.3!</title>

<para>
  Please read this document thoroughly before trying to install INN. You'll be
  glad you did.

  If you are upgrading from a previous release of INN (pre-2.0) then it is
  recommended that you make copies of your old configuration files and use them
  as guides for doing a clean installation and configuration of 2.3. Many
  config files have changed, some have been added, and some have been removed.
  You'll find it much easier to start with a fresh install than to try to
  update your old installation.

    INN requires Perl to build and to run several subsystems.  Though
    some perl scripts are compatible with Perl 4, some features (such as
    script embedded in the server) mandate Perl 5.  An audit has not yet
    been done on what the minimum version of Perl for all features is, so
    it is recommended that you have at least Perl version 5.004.  For
    instructions on obtaining and installing Perl, see
    http://language.perl.com/info/software.html.

    The INN Makefiles use the syntax "include FILE", rather than the
    syntax common on BSDish systems of ".include <FILE>".  If your system
    expects the BSDish syntax, you can address this in two ways: change
    each Makefile's "include" lines, or install GNU Make from
    ftp://ftp.gnu.ai.mit.edu.  If you choose the latter route, make
    sure that the "make" command in site/do-subst.sh points to GNU Make.

    If you want to enable support for authenticated control messages (this is
    NOT required) then you will need to install PGP.  There are some questions
    involving PGP's license if you are running a commercial installation of
    INN (i.e. you are an ISP).  See http://www.pgp.com for more information
    about PGP.
