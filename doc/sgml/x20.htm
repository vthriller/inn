>In order to build INN, you will need a C compiler that understands ANSI C.
If you are trying to install INN on an operating system that doesn't have
an ANSI C compiler (such as SunOS), installing gcc is recommended. You can
get it from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gcc/ or its mirrors. INN is tested with gcc
more thoroughly than with any other compiler, so even if you have another
compiler available, you may wish to use gcc instead.

>INN requires Perl to build and to run several subsystems. Though most of
those components are compatible with Perl 4, some features (such as script
embedded in the server) mandate Perl 5. Effort is made to ensure that all
parts of INN will work with Perl 5.004; older versions may or may not be
adequate. It's therefore recommended that you have at least Perl 5.004
installed before attempting to compile INN. For instructions on obtaining
and installing Perl, see http://www.perl.com/latest/.

>The INN Makefiles use the syntax <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>include FILE</TT
>, rather than the syntax common on BSDish systems of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.include &lt;FILE&gt;</TT
>. If your system expects the BSDish syntax, you can address this in two
ways: change each Makefile's include lines, or install GNU make
(ftp://ftp.gnu.org/make/). If you choose the latter route, make sure that
the path to make in
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>site/do-subst.sh</I
> points to GNU make.
&#13;</P

>FIXME: Is this reference to <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>site/do-subst.sh</I
> still needed? Is there any way we can make autoconf handle this for us,
including putting the right make program in <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>site/do-subst.sh</I
>? (Is anyone still using subst or this script now that the build system
isn't any more?)

>If you want to enable support for authenticated control messages (this is
NOT required) then you will need to install PGP. Unfortunately, the
licensing restrictions on PGP are extremely unclear; it's possible that if
you are installing INN for a company, even if the news server is not part
of the business of that company, you would need to purchase a commercial
license for PGP. For an educational or non-profit organization, this
shouldn't be a problem. See http://www.pgp.com/ for more information about
PGP, including the licensing restrictions.
&#13;</P
><P
>You may also want to look at GnuPG (http://www.gnupg.org/), a free software
OpenPGP implementation. Unfortunately, most control message signatures are
currently PGP 2.6.2-compatible signatures, which cannot be handled by stock
GnuPG for patent reasons. However, there are add-on modules for GnuPG that
allow verification of those types of signatures, particularly if you are
outside the United States.

>Also, if you want to use either the Tcl or Python embedded hooks, you'll
need to have suitable versions of Tcl and/or Python installed. See
README.tcl_hook and README.python_hook for more information.
