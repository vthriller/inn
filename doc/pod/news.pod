Here are the changes for the latest version of INN.

=over 2

=item *

New F<readers.conf> file (replaces F<nnrp.access>) which allows more
flexible specification of access restrictions.

=item *

Unified overview has been replaced with an overview API, and there are now
two separate overview implementations to choose from.  One (tradindexed)
is very like traditional overview but uses an additional index file for
faster responses to readers.  The other (buffindexed) uses circular
buffers and can handle a higher incoming article rate while still being
fast for readers.  The ovmethod key in F<inn.conf> chooses the overview
method to use.

=item *

All article storage and retrieval is now done via the storage API.
Traditional spool is now available as a storage type under the storage
API.

=item *

The timecaf storage method has been added, similar to timehash but storing
multiple articles in a single file.  See F<INSTALL> for details on it.

=item *

INN now supports embedded Python filters as well as Perl and TCL filters.

=over 2

New storage.conf file (replaces storage.ctl).

New (optional) way of handling non-cancel control messages (controlchan)

storms.

Support for actsyncd to fetch active file with ftp; configured by default

actsyncd.  Be sure to read the manual page for actsync to configure an
actsync.ign file for your site, and test simpleftp if you do not configure
with wget or ncftp.  Also see ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/usenet/CONFIG/README.
