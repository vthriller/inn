=head1 NAME

ovdb_monitor - Database maintenance

=head1 SYNOPSYS

Use C<ovdb_init> to start ovdb_monitor

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When started (by C<ovdb_init>), C<ovdb_monitor> forks three processes
that perform routine database maintenance tasks.  These are:
transaction checkpointing, deadlock detection, and transaction log
removal.  The process ID of the parent is written to
F<I<pathrun>/ovdb_monitor.pid>.  This PID is used by other INN
commands to verify that ovdb_monitor is running.

To shut down ovdb_monitor, send a TERM signal to the process ID
in F<I<pathrun>/ovdb_monitor.pid> .  The parent process will shut
down the three children and wait for their exit before exiting itself.
