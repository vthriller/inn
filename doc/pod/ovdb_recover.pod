=head1 NAME

ovdb_recover - Perform recovery on the ovdb database, if needed

=head1 SYNOPSYS

ovdb_recover [-f]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Attempts to open the ovdb database, and if the database needs recovery,
it attempts to perform the recovery.  Similar in function to the BerkeleyDB
F<db_recover> command.

Specify the C<-f> option to force a recovery, even if the database
appears to not need it.  It is not an error to perform a recovery operation
on a clean database.  However, do not run C<ovdb_recover -f> while the
database is in use by any other processes.

Returns exit status of 0 if the database did not need recovery or if
recovery succeeded, and returns exit status 1 if recovery failed.  In
the latter case, the database may be damaged beyond repair, requiring
a rebuild with makehistory(8).

This command is normally called automatically by rc.news(8).
