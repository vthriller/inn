=head1 NAME

ovdb - Overview storage method for INN

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Ovdb is a storage method that uses the BerkeleyDB library to store overview
data.  It requires version 2.6.x or later of the BerkeleyDB library; it is
known to work well with version 2.7.7.  There is also a 3.0.55, but it is
not very stable (though ovdb will compile correctly with it).
Ovdb makes use of the full transaction/logging/locking functionality of the
BerkeleyDB environment.  BerkeleyDB may be downloaded from
http://www.sleepycat.com .

The BerkeleyDB distribution is (by default) installed into
F</usr/local/BerkeleyDB>, with subdirectories F<lib/>, F<include/>, and
F<bin/> for the library, headers, and support tools, respectively.
Version 3.x uses F</usr/local/BerkeleyDB.3.x> instead.
Ovdb uses some of the support tools in the F<bin/> subdirectory; namely
F<db_archive>, F<db_checkpoint>, and F<db_deadlock>.

=head1 INSTALLATION

To build ovdb support into INN, specify the option C<--with-berkeleydb>
when running the configure script.  By default, configure will use
F</usr/local/BerkeleyDB>.
If you installed it in a different location, you'll need to specify
that location like this (for example): C<--with-berkeleydb=/opt/BerkeleyDB>.

The ovdb database will take up more disk space for a given spool than
the other overview methods.  Plan on needing at least 1.1 KB for every
article in your spool (not counting crossposts).  So, if you have 5
million articles, you'll need at least 5.5 GB of disk space for ovdb.
With BerkeleyDB 2.x, the db files are 'grow only'; the library will
not shrink them, even if data is removed.  So, reserving extra space
above the estimate is a good idea.
Plus, you'll need additional space for transaction logs: at least 40 MB,
preferably 100 MB.  (The logs may be on a different filesystem
-- see the DB_CONFIG section.)

=head1 CONFIGURATION

To enable ovdb, set the I<ovmethod> parameter in F<inn.conf> to C<ovdb>.
The ovdb database is stored in the directory specified by the I<pathoverview>
paramter in F<inn.conf>.  This is the "DB_HOME" directory.  To start out,
this directory should be empty (other than an optional F<DB_CONFIG> file,
see the DB_CONFIG section for details) and innd (or makehistory) will
create the files as necessary in that directory.

Other parameters for configuring ovdb are in the optional F<ovdb.conf>
configuration file.  See also the sample F<ovdb.conf>.

=item numdbfiles

Overview data is split between this many files.  Currently,
innd will keep all of the files open, so don't set this too high
or innd may run out of file descriptors.  The nnrpds only open one
at a time, regardless.  May be set to one, or just a few, but only
do that if your OS supports large (>2G) files.
Warning: do NOT change this on an already established database.
Default is 32.

=item txn_nosync

If txn_nosync is set to false, BerkeleyDB flushes the log after every
transaction.  This minimizes the number of transactions that may be lost
in the event of a crash, but results in significantly degraded
performance.  Default is true.

=item cachesize

Size of the memory pool cache, in Kilobytes.  The cache will have a
backing store file in the DB directory which will be at least as big.
In general, the bigger the cache, the better.  Use C<db_stat -m> to see
cache hit percentages.  If they're less than 80%, try increasing the
cache size.  To make a change of this parameter take effect with an
existing database, remove the F<__db*> files while there are no
database processes running.  Default is 8000 K, which may be
adequate for small to medium-sized servers.  Full-feed servers will
probably need at least 14000.

=item pagesize

Sets the page size for the DB files (in bytes).  Must be a power of 2.
Best choices are 4096, 8192, or 16384.  The default is 8192.
You can not change the pagesize of an existing DB, it must be recreated.

=item minkey

Sets the minimum number of keys per page.  See the BerkeleyDB
documentation for more info.  Default is based on page size:

 default_minkey = pagesize / 2048

You can not change the minkey of an existing DB, it must be recreated.

=head2 DB_CONFIG

A file called F<DB_CONFIG> may be placed in the database directory to
customize where the various database files and transaction logs are
written.  By default, all of the files are written in the "DB_HOME"
directory.  One way to improve performance is to put the transaction
logs on a different disk.  To do this, put:

DB_LOG_DIR /path/to/logs

in the F<DB_CONFIG> file.  If the pathname you give starts with a /,
it is treated as an absolute path; otherwise, it is relative to the
"DB_HOME" directory.  Make sure that any directories you specify 
exist and have proper ownership/mode before starting INN, because 
they won't be created automatically.  Also, don't change the DB_CONFIG
file while anything that uses ovdb is running.

The DB_CONFIG functionality is part of BerkeleyDB itself.

=head1 RUNNING

You don't need to do anything special when starting or stopping INN
when using ovdb, as long as you use F<rc.news>.  When starting,
F<rc.news>:

=over 4

=item *

Runs C<ovdb_recover>.  This will perform any needed recovery on the
database; e.g., if there was a crash that may have left the database
in an inconsistent state.  This is done before innd is started.  If
the innd.pid file is present but innd is not running (i.e., unclean
shutdown), rc.news will supply the C<-f> argument to C<ovdb_recover>

=item *

Runs C<dbprocs start>.  This starts the DB housekeeping processes.

=back

And when stopping INN, F<rc.news> calls C<dbprocs stop> after the
other INN processes have been shut down.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

Problems relating to ovdb are logged to news.err with "OVDB" in the
error message.

If a program accessing the database crashes, or otherwise exits
uncleanly, it might leave a stale lock in the database.  This lock
could cause other processes to deadlock on that stale lock.  To
fix this, shut down all news processes (using
C<kill -9> if necessary) then run C<ovdb_recover -f> as the
news user, e.g.: C<su news -c "/PATHBIN/ovdb_recover -f">
This will remove all locks plus repair any damage caused by
killing deadlocked processes.

=head1 FILES

=over 4

=item inn.conf

The I<ovmethod> and I<pathoverview> parameters are relevant to ovdb.

=item ovdb.conf

Optional configuration file for tuning.  See CONFIGURATION section above.

=item I<pathoverview>

Directory where the database goes.  BerkeleyDB calls it the 'DB_HOME'
directory.

=item I<pathoverview>/DB_CONFIG

Optional file to configure the layout of the database files.

=back

=head1 TO DO

I've modified innshellvars and innshellvars.pl to add the BerkeleyDB
bin dir to PATH and set DB_HOME to innconf->pathoverview.  Since I
don't know TCL, someone needs to modify innshellvars.tcl in the same
way.

Implement a way to limit how many databases can be open at once (to
reduce file descriptor usage); maybe using something similar to the
cache code in ov3.c
