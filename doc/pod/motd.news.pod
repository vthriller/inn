motd.news - Message of the day information for readers

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This file, found in I<pathetc>/motd.news, contains local information for
news readers in a free-form format.  The entire file is returned verbatim
to any client that issues the LIST MOTD command.  This might be used for
new information, notification of upcoming downtime, or similar purposes.

Be aware that use of the LIST MOTD command is not widespread and most news
clients will never ask for this file.

If this file is missing, it is not an error.  The server will just send
the client an empty response.
