=head1 NAME

ovdb_init - Prepare ovdb database for use

=head1 SYNOPSYS

ovdb_init [C<-u>|C<-r>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command must be run before any other process can access the
overview database.  It performs the following steps:

=over 4

=item 1

Creates the database environment, if necessary

=item 2

If the database is idle (and if the C<-u> option is not specified),
it performs a normal recovery.  The recovery will remove stale locks,
recreate the memory pool cache, and repair any damage caused by a system
crash or improper shutdown.

=item 3

If the C<-u> option is specified, it performs any necessary upgrades
to the database.  See the UPGRADING section below.

=item 4

Starts the DB housekeeping processes (ovdb_monitor) if they're not
already running. (Unless the C<-r> option is specified).

=back

Returns exit status of 0 if all steps were completed successfully.
In the event of an error, messages are written to syslog and/or stderr.

If a recovery was attempted but it failed, the database may be
damaged beyond repair, requiring a rebuild with makehistory(8).

This command is normally invoked automatically by rc.news(8).

It is OK to run this command multiple times.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item C<-r>

Perform recovery only.  C<ovdb_monitor> is not started.

=item C<-u>

Perform any needed upgrades.  Recovery is not attempted.
C<ovdb_monitor> is started if the upgrade succeeded.

=back

=head1 UPGRADING

There are two situations in which the database will need to be
upgraded:

=over 4

=item *

You upgrade the BerkeleyDB library to a newer version, for example
from 2.7.7 to 3.1.17.  In this case, the BerkeleyDB db->upgrade()
method is used.

=item *

You upgrade ovdb to a newer major version; i.e., ovdb-1.0 to ovdb-2.0.

=back

In both of these cases, the database is upgraded in-place; and the
upgrade can not be undone.  Do not interrupt the upgrade process once
it has started, because there is a risk of irrepairable corruption.
The upgrade may take several minutes to complete.
If an upgrade does get interrupted, try running the upgrade again.

Here's an example procedure to upgrade a database created with BerkeleyDB
2.7.7 to use BerkeleyDB 3.1.17:

=over 4

=item 1

Build and install the BerkeleyDB 3.1.17

=item 2

Run configure in the INN source tree and make sure it picks up the
right BerkeleyDB directory (e.g., /usr/local/BerkeleyDB.3.1)

=item 3

Do a C<make>

=item 4

Shut down INN (e.g., with C<rc.news stop>).  Be sure to kill all nnrpds as
well.

=item 5

Do a C<make update> to install the new binaries.

=item 6

Run C<ovdb_init -u> as the news user.

=item 7

Start INN with C<rc.news>

=back

It is OK to specify C<-u> even if no upgrades are needed.
