=head1 NAME

inndf - Report free disk, inodes, and overview information

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<inndf> [B<-hi>] I<directory> [I<directory> ...]

B<inndf> B<-n>

B<inndf> B<-o>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<inndf> was originally a replacement for C<df | awk> in innwatch.ctl(5)
and innstat(8), and now also reports various other usage information about
INN's storage that df(1) doesn't understand.  B<inndf> doesn't sync, forks
less, and is generally less complicated than df(1).

It's default behavior is to report free kilobytes (not disk blocks) or
free inodes if B<-i> is used in the file systems holding the directories
given on the command line.  (A kilobyte in this case is 1024 bytes.)  If
only one directory is given, the output will be a simple number; if more
than one directory is given, the output will be formatted for human
readability.

If I<enableoverview> set set to true in F<inn.conf>, B<inndf> can also be
used to get information about the overview database.  With the B<-n>
option, it reports a count of the total number of overview records stored.
With B<-o>, it reports the percentage of space used in the overview
database (for those overview methods where this is a meaningful question).

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-h>

Print a usage message and exit.

=item B<-i>

Report the number of free inodes rather than the number of free kilobytes.

=item B<-n>

Report the total number of records in the overview database.  Note that
crossposted articles will have one overview record for each newsgroup
they're posted to.

=item B<-o>

Report the percentage usage of the overview database space.  This is only
meaningful for overview methods that pre-allocate a certain amount of
space rather than grow to accomodate more records.  Currently, this flag
is only useful for the buffindexed overview method.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Print the free kilobytes in /news/spool as a simple number:

    inndf /news/spool

Report the free inodes in /usr/local/news and /news/spool in a format
designed for human readability:

    inndf -i /usr/local/news /news/spool

Print out the number of overview records and the percentage space used by
a buffindexed overview database:

    inndf -no
