=head1 NAME

pullnews - Pull news from one news server and feed it to another

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<pullnews> [B<-hqx>] [B<-c> I<config>] [B<-g> I<groups>] [B<-p> I<port>]
[B<-r> I<file>] [B<-s> I<to-server>] [I<from-server> ...]

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

The C<Net::NNTP> module must be installed.  This module is available as part
of the libnet distribution and comes with recent versions of Perl.  For
older versions of Perl, you can download it from L<http://www.cpan.org/>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<pullnews> reads a config file in the running user's home directory
(normally called F<~/.pullnews>) and connects to the upstream servers
given there as a reader client.  By default, it connects to all servers
listed in the configuration file, but you can limit B<pullnews> to
specific servers by listing them on the command line:  a whitespace-separated
list of server names can be specified, like I<from-server> for one of them.
For each server it connects to, it pulls over articles and feeds them to the
destination server via the IHAVE command.  This means that the system
B<pullnews> is run on must have feeding access to the destination news server.

B<pullnews> is designed for very small sites that don't want to bother
setting up traditional peering and is not meant for handling large feeds.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-c> I<config>

Normally, the config file is stored in F<~/.pullnews> for the user running
B<pullnews>.  If B<-c> is given, I<config> will be used as the config file
instead.  This is useful if you're running B<pullnews> as a system user on
an automated basis out of cron rather than as an individual user.

=item B<-g> I<groups>

Specifies a collection of groups to get.  I<groups> is a list of
newsgroups separated by commas (only commas, no spaces).  Each group must
be defined in the config file, and only the remote hosts that carry those
groups will be contacted.  Note that this is a simple list of groups, not
a wildmat expression, and wildcards are not supported.

=item B<-h>

Print a usage message and exit.

=item B<-p> I<port>

Connect to the destination news server on a port other than the default of
C<119>.  This option does not change the port used to connect to the remote
news servers.

=item B<-q>

Print out less status information while running.

=item B<-r> I<file>

Rather than feeding the downloaded articles to a local server, instead
create a batch file that can later be fed to a server using B<rnews>.  See
rnews(1) for more information about the batch file format.

=item B<-s> I<to-server>

Normally, B<pullnews> will feed the articles it retrieves to the news
server running on localhost.  To connect to a different host, specify a
server with the B<-s> flag.

=item B<-x>

If the B<-x> flag is used, an Xref: header is added to any article
that lacks one.  It can be useful for instance if articles are fed
to a news server which has I<xrefslave> set in F<inn.conf>.

=head1 CONFIG FILE

The config file for B<pullnews> is divided into blocks, one block for each
remote server to connect to.  A block begins with the host line, which
must have no leading whitespace and contains just the hostname of the
remote server.  Following this line should be one or more newsgroup lines
which start with whitespace followed by the name of a newsgroup to
retrieve.  Only one newsgroup should be listed on each line.

B<pullnews> will update the config file to include the time the group was
last checked and the highest numbered article successfully retrieved and
transferred to the destination server.  It uses this data to avoid doing
duplicate work the next time it runs.

The full syntax is:

    <host> [<username> <password>]
            <group> [<time> <high>]
            <group> [<time> <high>]

where the <host> line must not have leading whitespace and the <group>
lines must.  Note that you may optionally specify a username and password
for basic authentication to the remote server if necessary.

A typical configuration file would be:

    # Format group date high
    data.pa.vix.com
            rec.bicycles.racing 908086612 783
            rec.humor.funny 908086613 18
            comp.programming.threads
    nnrp.vix.com pull sekret
            comp.std.lisp

Note that an earlier run of B<pullnews> has filled in details about the
last article downloads from the two rec.* groups.  The two comp.* groups
were just added by the user and have not yet been checked.

The nnrp.vix.com server requires authentication, and B<pullnews> will use
the username C<pull> and the password C<sekret>.

=head1 FILES

=over 4

=item I<pathbin>/pullnews

The Perl script itself used to pull news from a server and feed it to another.

=item I<$HOME>/.pullnews

The default config file.  It is in the running user's home directory
(normally called F<~/.pullnews>).

=head1 BUGS

B<pullnews> is very simple and is lacking in more sophisticated features
(like killing articles based on user-defined conditions) that better pull
feeders most certainly have.  It also doesn't keep or log much detail on
articles transferred.

=head1 HISTORY

B<pullnews> was written by James Brister for INN.  The documentation was
rewritten in POD by Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu>.
