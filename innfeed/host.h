 * Description: The public interface to the Host class.
 *
 *              The Host class represents the remote news system
 *              that we're feeding. A Host object has possibly
 *              multiple connections to the remote system which it
 *              sends articles down. It is given the articles by
 *              other objects (typically the InnListener), and once
 *              taken it assumes all responsibility for transmission
 *              or temporary storage on network failures etc.

/*
 * Functions used by the InnListener
 */


/*
 * Create a new Host object.
 *
 * NAME is the name that INN uses.
 * IPNAME is the name the networking code uses (or the ascii dotted quad
 *    IP address).
 * ARTTIMEOUT is the max amount of time we'll wait for a new article
 *    from INN before considering the connection unused and we'll close
 *    down.
 * RESPTIMEOUT is the max amount of time we'll wait for any reponse
 *    from a remote. Past this we'll close down the network connection.
 * INITIALCXNS is the number of Connections to create at Host creation time.
 * MAXCXNS is the maximum number of parallel connections to the
 *    remote host we can run at any one time.
 * MAXCHECK is the maximum number of nntp CHECK commands to be outstanding
 *    on a connection before opening up a new connection (or refusing
 *    new articles if we get to MAXCXNS).
 * PORTNUM is the port number on the remote host we should talk to.
 * CLOSEPERIOD is the number of seconds after connecting that the
 *     connections should be closed down and reinitialized (due to problems
 *     with old NNTP servers that hold history files open. Value of 0 means
 *     dont close down.
 * STREAMING is a boolean flag to tell if the Host wants its Connections to
 *     do streaming or not.
 * LOWPASSHIGH is the high value for the low-pass filter.
 * LOWPASSLOW is the low value for the low-pass filter.
