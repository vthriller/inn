 * Description: The public interface to articles. The articles are
 *              implemented via reference counting. This interface
 *              provides the methods for getting the contents of the article.
 *
 *              When an Article is created there's a chance that another
 *              copy of it already exists. For example if the Article is
 *              pulled out of a Tape for a particular host it may already
 *              be in existance in some other host. This class will manage
 *              this situation to prevent multiple copies of the article
 *              being in core.
