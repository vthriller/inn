##  Generate a ChangeLog from cvs log using cvs2cl and fixlog.

##  This script prompts the user for a date from which to pull log entries,
##  a tag to select what files one wants log information for, and the path
##  to cvs2cl and generates a ChangeLog file from that information and by
##  running cvs log.
