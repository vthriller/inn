/*
**  Set a file descriptor to nonblocking (or clear the nonblocking flag if
**  flag is false).
**
**  Always use O_NONBLOCK; O_NDELAY is *not* the same thing historically.
**  The semantics of O_NDELAY are that if the read would block, it returns 0
**  instead.  This is indistinguishable from an end of file condition.
**  POSIX added O_NONBLOCK, which requires read to return -1 and set errno
**  to EAGAIN, which is what we want.
**
**  FNDELAY (4.3BSD) originally did the correct thing, although it has a
**  different incompatibility (affecting all users of a socket rather than
**  just a file descriptor and returning EWOULDBLOCK instead of EAGAIN) that
**  we don't care about in INN.  Using it is *probably* safe, but BSD should
**  also have the ioctl, and at least on Solaris FNDELAY does the same thing
**  as O_NDELAY, not O_NONBLOCK.  So if we don't have O_NONBLOCK, fall back
**  to the ioctl instead.
**
**  Reference:  Stevens, Advanced Unix Programming, pg. 364.
**
**  Note that O_NONBLOCK is known not to work on earlier versions of ULTRIX,
**  SunOS, and AIX, possibly not setting the socket nonblocking at all,
**  despite the fact that they do define it.  It works in later SunOS and,
**  current AIX, however, and a 1999-10-25 survey of current operating
**  systems failed to turn up any that didn't handle it correctly (as
**  required by POSIX), while HP-UX 11.00 did use the broken return-zero
**  semantics of O_NDELAY (most other operating systems surveyed treated
**  O_NDELAY as synonymous with O_NONBLOCK).  Accordingly, we currently
**  unconditionally use O_NONBLOCK.  If this causes too many problems, an
**  autoconf test may be required.
