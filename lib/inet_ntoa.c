**  Replacement for a missing or broken inet_ntoa.
**
**  Written by Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu>
**  This work is hereby placed in the public domain by its author.
**
**  Provides the same functionality as the standard library routine
**  inet_ntoa for those platforms that don't have it or where it doesn't
**  work right (such as on IRIX when using gcc to compile).  inet_ntoa is
**  not thread-safe since it uses static storage (inet_ntop should be used
**  instead when available).
