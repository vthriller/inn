**
**  Timer functions, to gather profiling data.
**
**  These functions log profiling information about where the server spends
**  its time.  While this doesn't provide as detailed of information as a
**  profiling build would, it's much faster and simpler, and since it's fast
**  enough to always leave on even on production servers, it can gather
**  information *before* it's needed and show long-term trends.
**
**  Functions that should have their time monitored need to call TMRstart(n)
**  at the beginning of the segment of code and TMRstop(n) at the end.  The
**  time spent will be accumulated and added to the total for the counter n,
**  where n should be one of the constants in timer.h or defined in your
**  application.  If you add new timers in the library code, add them to
**  timer.h and also add a description to TMRsummary; if you add them in
**  your application add them to your own description array.  Also add them
**  to innreport.
**
**  Calls are sanity-checked to some degree and errors reported via
**  warn/die, so all callers should have the proper warn and die handlers
**  set up, if appropriate.
**
**  Recursion is not allowed on a given timer.  Setting multiple timers
**  at once is fine (i.e., you may have a timer for the total time to write
**  an article, how long the disk write takes, how long the history update
**  takes, etc. which are components of the total article write time).  If a
**  timer is started while another timer is running, the new timer is
**  considered to be a sub-timer of the running timer, and must be stopped
**  before the parent timer is stopped.  Note that the same timer number can
**  be a sub-timer of more than one timer or a timer without a parent, and
**  each of those counts will be reported separately.
**
**  innreport can't currently handle nested timers.
**
**  Note that this code is not thread-safe and in fact would need to be
**  completely overhauled for a threaded server (since the idea of global
**  timing statistics doesn't make as much sense when different tasks are
**  done in different threads).

/* Timer values are stored in a series of trees.  This allows use to use
   nested timers.  Each nested timer node is linked to three of its
   neighbours to make lookups easy and fast.  The current position in the
   graph is given by timer_current.

   As an optimization, since most timers aren't nested, timer_list holds an
   array of pointers to non-nested timers that's filled in as TMRstart is
   called so that the non-nested case remains O(1).  That array is stored in
   timers.  This is the "top level" of the timer trees; if timer_current is
   NULL, any timer that's started is found in this array.  If timer_current
   isn't NULL, there's a running timer, and starting a new timer adds to
   that tree.

   Note that without the parent pointer, this is a tree.  id is the
   identifier of the timer.  start stores the time (relative to the last
   summary) at which TMRstart was last called for each timer.  total is
   the total time accrued by that timer since the last summary.  count is
   the number of times the timer has been stopped since the last summary. */
