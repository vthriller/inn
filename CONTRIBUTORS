The following is a list of the people who've helped out by contributing
code since I took over the project.  More people have contributed code to
INN before I started managing it. If anyone's name has been left out
(probably), or if I've not correctly attributed something to you (ditto),
please let me know (don't be embarrased). Same goes for past contributors.

Rich Salz:
	Designed and wrote most of it.

Bob Halley:
	Did the TCL extension.

Christophe Wolfhugel:
	Did the Perl extension.

Doug Needham:
	Made nnrpd spool if innd is unavailable.
	Made nnrpd handle the LIST SUBSCRIPTIONS command.
	Added the rebilding of control connections to innd (SIGUSR1 handling)
	Got inews to ask the nntp peer for moderator info instead of
	   digging it out of a local file.

	Did the hooks for PGP verificiation of control messages.
