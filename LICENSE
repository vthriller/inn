Some specific portions of INN are covered by different licenses, usually
more permissive ones.  Those licenses, if present, will be noted
prominantly at the top of those source files.  Specifically (but possibly
not comprehensively):

   authprogs/pwcheck.c may only be used for non-commercial purposes and by
   Internet Service Providers and other entities for internal purposes.
   See the beginning of the file for full details.

   authprogs/smbval/* and control/perl-nocem.in are under the GNU General
   Public License.  See doc/GPL for a copy of this license.

   backends/shrinkfile.c, frontends/scanspool.in, lib/concat.c,
   lib/hstrerror.c, lib/inet_aton.c, lib/inet_ntoa.c, lib/memcmp.c,
   lib/parsedate.y, lib/pread.c, lib/pwrite.c, lib/setenv.c, lib/seteuid.c,
   and lib/strerror.c are in the public domain.

   control/gpgverify.in, control/pgpverify.in and control/signcontrol.in
   are under a license very similar to the above but with UUNET
   Technologies, Inc. as the copyright holder.  See the end of those files
   for details.

   control/controlchan.in and control/modules/*.pl are covered by only the
   first two license points of the license above; points 3 and 4 do not
   apply to them.  See the beginning of those files for details.

   lib/strcasecmp.c, lib/strspn.c, and lib/strtok.c are taken from BSD
   sources and are covered by the standard BSD license.  See those files
   for more details.

   lib/md5.c is covered under the standard free MD5 license from RSA Data
   Security.  See the file for more details.

   libhist/his.c and libhist/hisv6/hisv6.c are under a license very
   similar to the new BSD license but with Thus plc as the copyright
   holder.  See those files for details.

   tests/runtests.c is covered under a license very similar to the MIT/X
   Consortium license (less restrictive than INN's licese).  See the
   beginning of the file for details.

Note that all portions of INN that link with core INN code have to be
convered by licenses compatible with the license at the top of this file.
Some portions of this distribution are covered by incompatible licenses,
but all of that code is completely stand-alone and compiles into a
separate executable.  (This is why it's permissable to distribute some
programs covered by the GPL as part of this distribution; they compile to
stand-alone executables or are stand-alone scripts and therefore fall
under the "mere aggregation" clause of the GPL.)

Please note that the files in the contrib directory are not properly part
of INN and may be under widely varying licenses.  Please each file and/or
its documentation for license information.
