Hacking INN

    This file is for people who are interested in making modifications to
    INN.  Normal users can safely skip reading it.  It is intended primarily
    as a guide, resource, and accumulation of tips for maintainers and
    contributors, and secondarily as documentation of some of INN's
    internals.

    This is $Revision$ dated $Date$.

Configuring

    INN uses autoconf to probe the system on which it is being compiled and
    adjust how it does things to try to be as portable as possible.  The
    shell script configure at the top level of the source tree is
    autogenerated by autoconf from configure.in, and include/config.h.in is
    autogenerated by autoheader from configure.in and include/acconfig.h. 
    At configure time, configure generates include/config.h and several
    other files based on options it was given and what it discovers about
    the target system.

    All modifications to configure should instead be made to configure.in. 
    Similarly, modifications to include/config.h.in should instead be made
    to include/acconfig.h.  The autoconf manual (available using info
    autoconf if you have autoconf and the GNU info utilities installed on
    your system) is a valuable reference when making any modifications.

    To regenerate configure, just run `autoconf'.  To regenerate
    include/config.h.in, run:

        autoheader -l include

    to tell it where to find acconfig.h.

    The generated files are checked into the CVS repository so that people
    working on INN don't have to have autoconf on their system, and to make
    packaging easier.

    At the time of this writing, autoconf 2.13 is being used, but 2.12
    should work as well.

    The files config.guess and config.sub at the top level of the source
    tree are from autoconf, and should periodically be updated to the latest
    versions distributed with autoconf.  They do contain some modifications,
    however, so be sure to merge rather than just replace.  (The
    modifications should be contributed back to the autoconf maintainers so
    that eventually this won't be necessary.)

    INN also has some support for libtool; at the time of this writing, it
    doesn't work right at least on some platforms and is due for an update
    and clean-up.  ltconfig, ltmain.sh, and aclocal.m4 are part of the
    libtool support.  INN should not compile with libtool by default, only
    when requested, since otherwise normal compilations are quite slow. 
    (Using libtool is not without some cost.)

Documentation

    INN's documentation is currently somewhat in a state of flux.  The vast
    majority is still in the form of man pages written directly in nroff. 
    Some parts of the documentation have been rewritten in POD; that
    documentation can be found in doc/pod.  The canonical source for the
    README, README.perl_hook, and INSTALL files is also in POD.  In
    addition, DocBook SGML versions of the POD documentation are included
    both for the use of DocBook translators and to make conversion to SGML
    easier if necessary down the road.

    If you're modifying some part of INN's documentation and see that it has
    a POD version in doc/pod, it's preferred if you can make the
    modifications to the POD source and then regenerate the derived files. 
    For a quick introduction to POD, see the perlpod(1) man page on your
    system (it should be installed if you have Perl installed).

    When writing new documentation, write in whatever format you care to; if
    necessary, we can always convert it to POD or whatever else we want to
    use.  Having the documentation exist in *some* form is more important
    than what language you write it in.  If you really don't have any
    particular preference, there's a slight preference currently for POD.

    The pod2text and pod2man scripts that come with Perl versions prior to
    5.6 are adequate but not ideal for processing INN's documentation.  The
    best converters are available as part of the podlators package,
    available from CPAN (ftp.perl.org or another mirror) in
    modules/by-module/Pod.  This module also requires installation of
    PodParser, found in the same directory, and File::Spec for versions of
    Perl before 5.005.  File::Spec you can find in modules/by-module/File.

    To generate text documentation (like INSTALL or README), use:

        pod2text -s -l install.pod > ../../INSTALL

    from the doc/pod directory.  `-s' preserves two spaces after periods and
    `-l' adds a blank line after major headings.

    To generate a man page from POD source, use:

        pod2roff -c "InterNetNews Documentation" -r "INN 2.3" in > out

    where in is the name of the POD file and out is what to name the *roff
    output.  For some documentation, you also have to provide -s <section>
    to set the correct manual section (pod2roff will assume section 1 if -s
    isn't given).  It's best to run pod2roff from the doc/pod directory,
    directing the output to the appropriate file in the doc/man directory,
    since it does some tricks with the name of the file to determine the
    title of the man page and can be confused by longer paths.

    At some point this should go into Makefile rules.

    pod2text and pod2roff from podlators are included with Perl as of the
    5.005_62 development version and will be included in Perl 5.6.

    For conversion of POD to DocBook SGML, use Pod::DocBook, also found on
    CPAN in modules/by-module/Pod.

    The current versions of these tools as of this writing are podlators
    0.08, PodParser 1.085, and Pod::DocBook 0.05.

Include Files

    Include files relevant to all of INN, or relevant to the two libraries
    built as part of INN (the utility libinn library and the libstorage
    library that contains all storage and overview functions) are found in
    the include directory; other include files relevant only to a portion of
    INN are found in the relevant directory.

    Practically all INN source files will start with:

        #include "config.h"
        #include "clibrary.h"

    The first picks up all defines generated by autoconf and is necessary
    for types that may not be present on all systems (uid_t, pid_t, size_t,
    int32_t, and the like).  It therefore should be included before any
    other headers that use those types, as well as to get general
    configuration information.

    The second is portably equivalent to:

        #include <sys/types.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <stdlib.h>
        #include <stddef.h>
        #include <stdint.h>
        #include <string.h>
        #include <limits.h>
        #include <unistd.h>

    except that it doesn't include headers that are missing on a given
    system, replaces functions not found on the system with the INN
    equivalents, provides macros that INN assumes are available but which
    weren't found, and defines some additional portability things.  Even if
    this is more headers than the source file actually needs, it's generally
    better to just include clibrary.h rather than trying to duplicate the
    autoconf-driven hackery that it does to do things portably.  The primary
    exception is for source files in lib that only define a single function
    and are used for portability; those may want to include only config.h so
    that they can be easily used in other projects that use autoconf. 
    config.h is a fairly standard header name for this purpose.

    clibrary.h does also include config.h, but it's somewhat poor form to
    rely on this; it's better to explicitly list the header dependencies for
    the benefit of someone else reading the code.

    Another frequently included header file is macros.h, which defines the
    NEW(), COPY(), and DISPOSE() macros that are used throughout INN for
    memory management rather than directly calling malloc(), strdup(), and
    free().  (They actually use xmalloc() instead, so you don't have to
    check the return value, and they make it easier to plug in a debugging
    memory allocator when trying to track down memory leaks or clobbers.)

    paths.h includes a wide variety of paths determined at configure time,
    both default paths to various parts of INN and paths to programs.  Don't
    just use the default paths, though, if they're also configurable in
    inn.conf; instead, call ReadInnConf() and use the global innconf
    structure.

    Other files in include, most notably libinn.h, are interfaces to
    particular bits of INN library functionality or are used for other
    purposes; see the comments in each file.

    Finally, many INN source files still include configdata.h; this header
    file is now obsolete (merged into config.h and clibrary.h) and should be
    removed where it appears.  The one exception to this may be in the
    innfeed tree, which is organized somewhat differently than the rest of
    INN and has its own config.h, making for some interesting naming
    conflicts that should be studied carefully before a project to fix them
    is undertaken.

Coding Style

    INN has quite a variety of coding styles intermixed.  As with all
    programs, it's preferrable when making minor modifications to keep the
    coding style of the code you're modifying.  In INN, that will vary by
    file.

    If you're writing a substantial new piece of code, the prevailing
    "standard" INN coding style appears to be something like the following:

    *  Roughly BSD style (four space indents, no space before the parens
       around function arguments, open brace on the same line as
       if/while/for, and close and open brace on the same line as else).

    *  Introductory comments for functions or files are generally written
       as:

           /*
           **  Introductory comment.
           */

       Other multiline comments in the source are generally written as:

           /* This is a
              multiline comment. */

       Comments before functions saying what they do are nice to have.  In
       general, the RCS/CVS Id tag is on the first line of each source file.

    *  Checks for NULL pointers are preferrably written out explicitly; in
       other words, use:

           if (p != NULL)

       rather than:

           if (p)

       to make it clearer what the code is assuming.

    The source is currently full of some rather odd casts, including a lot
    of casts to void when calling standard functions.  These are historical,
    designed to make lint shut up.  Don't feel like you have to preserve
    them provided that gcc -Wall doesn't complain when they're removed.

    Note that this is only a rough guideline and the maintainers aren't
    style nazis; we're more interested in your code contribution than in how
    you write it.

    Finally, if possible, please don't use tabs in source files, since they
    can expand differently in different environments.  In particular, please
    try not to use the mix of tabs and spaces that is the default in emacs. 
    If you use emacs to edit INN code, you may want to put:

        ; Use only spaces when indenting or centering, no tabs.
        (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)

    in your ~/.emacs file.
