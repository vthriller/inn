Here are the changes for the latest version of INN.

Current:
	- New readers.conf file (replaces nnrp.access)

Version 2.2:

	- New storage.conf file (replaces storage.ctl).
	- New (optional) way of handling non-cancel control 
	  messages (controlchan) that serializes them and 
	  prevents server overload from control message storms
        - Support for actsyncd to fetch active file with ftp;
          configured by default to get the one at
          <URL:ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/usenet/CONFIG/active.Z>
          if you run actsyncd.  Be sure to read the manual
          page for actsyncd to configure an actsync.ign file
          for your site, and test simpleftp if you do not configure
          with wget or ncftp.  Also see
          <URL:ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/usenet/CONFIG/README>.
	- Some options to configure are now moved to inn.conf
	  (merge-to-groups and pgp-verify).
	- inndf, a portable version of df(1) is supplied.
	- New cnfsstat program to show stats of cnfs buffers.
	- news2mail program for gateway'ing news into email is provided.
	- mailpost program for gateway'ing email to news is provided.
	- pullnews program for doing a sucking feed is provided (not meant 
	  for large feeds)
	- The innshellvars.csh.in script is obsolete (and lives in the
	  obsolete directory, for now).
