Here are the changes for the latest version of INN.

Version 2.2.3

	- INN no longer installs inews setgid news or rnews setuid root by
	  default.  If you need the old behavior, --enable-uucp-rnews or
	  --enable-setgid-inews must be given to configure.  See INSTALL
	  for more information.
	- A security hole when verifycancels is turned on in inn.conf (not
	  the default) was fixed.
	- Message IDs are now limited to 250 octets to prevent
	  interoperability problems with other servers.
	- Various other security paranoia fixes have been made.
	- Embedded Perl filters fixed to work with Perl 5.6.0.
	- Lots of bug fixes.

Version 2.2.2

	- Various minor bug fixes and a y2k bug fix. The y2k bug is in version 
	  version 2.2.1 only and will show up after Jan 1st when a news reader
	  issues a NEWNEWS command for a date prior to the year 2000. 

Version 2.2.1

        - Various bug fixes. Most importantly, bug fixes to potential 
          security holes (buffer overflow type).

Version 2.2:

	- New storage.conf file (replaces storage.ctl).
	- New (optional) way of handling non-cancel control 
	  messages (controlchan) that serializes them and 
	  prevents server overload from control message storms
        - Support for actsyncd to fetch active file with ftp;
          configured by default to get the one at
          <URL:ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/usenet/CONFIG/active.Z>
          if you run actsyncd.  Be sure to read the manual
          page for actsync to configure an actsync.ign file
          for your site, and test simpleftp if you do not configure
          with wget or ncftp.  Also see
          <URL:ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/usenet/CONFIG/README>.
	- Some options to configure are now moved to inn.conf
	  (merge-to-groups and pgp-verify).
	- inndf, a portable version of df(1) is supplied.
	- New cnfsstat program to show stats of cnfs buffers.
	- news2mail program for gateway'ing news into email is provided.
	- mailpost program for gateway'ing email to news is provided.
	- pullnews program for doing a sucking feed is provided (not meant 
	  for large feeds)
	- The innshellvars.csh.in script is obsolete (and lives in the
	  obsolete directory, for now).
