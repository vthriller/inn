Current

    Here are the changes for the latest version of INN.

    * New readers.conf file (replaces nnrp.access) which allows more
      flexible specification of access restrictions.

    * Unified overview has been replaced with an overview API, and there are
      now two separate overview implementations to choose from.  One
      (tradindexed) is very like traditional overview but uses an additional
      index file for faster responses to readers.  The other (buffindexed)
      uses circular buffers and can handle a higher incoming article rate
      while still being fast for readers.  The ovmethod key in inn.conf
      chooses the overview method to use.

    * All article storage and retrieval is now done via the storage API. 
      Traditional spool is now available as a storage type under the storage
      API.

    * The timecaf storage method has been added, similar to timehash but
      storing multiple articles in a single file.  See INSTALL for details
      on it.

    * INN now supports embedded Python filters as well as Perl and TCL
      filters.

Version 2.2

    * New storage.conf file (replaces storage.ctl).

    * New (optional) way of handling non-cancel control messages
      (controlchan) that serializes them and prevents server overload from
      control message storms.

    * Support for actsyncd to fetch active file with ftp; configured by
      default to get the one at ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/usenet/CONFIG/active.Z
      if you run actsyncd.  Be sure to read the manual page for actsync to
      configure an actsync.ign file for your site, and test simpleftp if you
      do not configure with wget or ncftp.  Also see
      ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/usenet/CONFIG/README.

    * Some options to configure are now moved to inn.conf (merge-to-groups
      and pgp-verify).

    * inndf, a portable version of df(1) is supplied.

    * New cnfsstat program to show stats of cnfs buffers.

    * news2mail program for gateway'ing news into email is provided.

    * mailpost program for gateway'ing email to news is provided.

    * pullnews program for doing a sucking feed is provided (not meant for
      large feeds).

    * The innshellvars.csh.in script is obsolete (and lives in the obsolete
      directory, for now).
