##  newsfeeds - determine where Usenet articles get sent
##
##  Format:
##	site[/exclude,exclude...]\
##		:pattern,pattern...[/distrib,distrib...]\
##		:flag,flag...\
##		:param
##
##  This file is complicated -- see newsfeeds(5) for full details.

##  The ME feed entry is special magic.
##
##  "/exclude" entries will cause INN to reject all articles that have
##  passed through those listed sites (by matching Path: entries).  There
##  are some "pseudo-sites" in general use that can be listed as exclusions
##  to reject specific types of 3rd-party cancel messages (see the "Cancel
##  FAQ" in news.admin.net-abuse.usenet):
##	cyberspam	Cancels for spam, munged articles, binaries
##	spewcancel	Cancels for munged articles and runaway gateways
##	bincancel	Cancels for binary postings to non-binary groups
##
##  The "pattern" field gives the initial subscription list for all other
##  feeds specified in this file.  These patterns are *prepended* to all
##  other feed patterns.  Using this feature is confusing and mildly
##  discouraged; make sure you understand the man page.
##
##  "/distrib" specifies what distributions the server will accept.  If any
##  distributions are listed there, the server will accept only articles
##  with those distributions.  If all the distributions listed are negated
##  (starting with !), then the server will only accept articles without
##  those distributions.
##
##  Patterns affect *outgoing* feeds.  Distributions affect *incoming*
##  feeds.

# Empty default subscription list, reject all incoming articles with a
# distribution of "local" or "collabra-internal," accept all others.
ME:!*/!local,!collabra-internal::

##  Uncomment if you're using innfeed.  This feed tells INN how to run
##  innfeed, and then every site you're feeding with innfeed has a
##  flag of Tm and an argument of "innfeed!" to funnel into this feed.
##  The feed pattern for innfeed should *always* be "!*"; don't ever
##  feed articles directly into innfeed.
##
##  Add "-y" as an option to startinnfeed to use the name of each feed as
##  the name of the host to feed articles to; without "-y" an innfeed.conf
##  file is needed.

# innfeed funnel master.
#innfeed!\
#	:!*,\
#	:Tc,Wnm*:@prefix@/bin/startinnfeed

##  Uncomment if usecontrolchan is set to true in inn.conf.  See INSTALL
##  for more information.

# Send non-cancel control messages through controlchan.
#controlchan!\
#	:!*,control,control.*,!control.cancel\
#	:Tc,Wnsm:@prefix@/bin/controlchan

##  Only uncomment this feed if both enableoverview and useoverchan are
##  set to true in inn.conf.  By default, innd will write out overview
##  internally and doesn't need or want this feed, but useoverchan can
##  optionally be set to true and this feed uncommented to move those
##  operations out of innd's main loop.

# News overview.
#overview!:*:Tc,WnteO:@prefix@/bin/overchan


##  OUTGOING NORMAL FEED EXAMPLES

# A real-time feed through innfeed.  Don't send articles with a distribution
# of "foo", since those articles are internal.
#news.uu.net/uunet\
#	:!junk,!control*/!foo\
#	:Tm:innfeed!

# Create a batch file in @SPOOLDIR@/outgoing for all articles
# that haven't already passed through nic.near.net.  The batch file will
# be named nic.near.net, the default file name, and either nntpsend or
# send-nntp can send articles from that spool file.
#nic.near.net\
#	:!junk,!control*/!foo\
#	:Tf,Wnm:

# A UUCP feed, where we try to keep the "batching" between 4K and 1K.
#ihnp4\
#	:!junk,!control/!foo\
#	:Tf,Wnb,B4096/1024:


##  OUTGOING SPECIAL FEED EXAMPLES

# Feed all moderated source postings to an archiver.
#source-archive!:!*,*sources*,!*wanted*,!*.d\
#	:Tc,Wn:@prefix@/bin/archive -f -i @SPOOLDIR@/archive/INDEX

# News to mail gateway.  Similar to innfeed, this uses a master feed and
# then individual feeds for every separate address that news is being
# gated to.  This sends all posts to rec.pets.redants.* to the address
# news-software@example.com.
#news2mail!:!*,Tc,Ac,Wn*:@prefix@/bin/news2mail
#news-software@example.com:rec.pets.redants.*:Tm:news2mail!

# Capture all local postings (with a distribution of "foo" and no more
# than two sites in the Path) using a local program (that doesn't come with
# INN).
#capture\
#	:*/foo\
#	:Tp,H2:/usr/local/bin/capture %s
