  * nnrpd/misc.c (1.28.2.5):
    Made 2 digit years in NEWGROUPS/NEWNEWS compatible with the draft NNTP
    standard.

Mon Aug 23 23:13:19 1999 David C Lawrence <tale>

  * samples/mod-active.in (1.1.2.2):
    made the flag for a short diff listing more portable

Sun Aug 22 06:25:10 1999 Russ Allbery <rra>

  * frontends/inews.c (1.15.2.5):
    Fixes for several potential buffer overflows, some more likely than
    others.
    Various sanity checks added to ensure strings aren't longer than
    working
    buffers.  I *think* all strcpy() and sprintf() calls are now okay, but
    the
    code should really be rewritten to make better use of dynamic buffers.

Sat Aug 21 04:35:18 1999 Russ Allbery <rra>

  * frontends/inews.c (1.15.2.4):
    Jeff King <peff@dbd.com>:
    There is no bounds-checking on "from" headers given on the command
    line;
    when copied into SMBUF-sized buffers, an overflow can occur and
    arbitrary
    code can be executed.

  * nnrpd/newnews.c (1.9.2.2):
    nnrpd/newnews.c:
	    - reported by Markus Stumpf <maex@Space.Net>
	    - the result of newnews includes trailing '\t' for traditional

Wed Aug 04 03:22:12 1999  <kondou>

  * samples/parsecontrol.in (1.18.2.2):
    samples/parsecontrol.in:
	    - checkgroups failed for non-controlchan

Wed Jul 14 13:27:07 1999  <kondou>

  * nnrpd/post.c (1.28.2.8):
    nnrpd/post.c

Wed Jul 07 18:50:38 1999 David C Lawrence <tale>

  * lib/makedir.c (1.3.2.1):
    MakeDir() should have its errno determined by mkdir().  Cases where
    mkdir() failed resulted in errno having the value of a subsequent
    stat().  This fix was made earlier to the CURRENT branch by someone
    else (I did not check who) and I am just applying it in 2.2's STABLE
    as a bug fix.

    samples/nntpsend.in:
	    - From: Russell Vincent <russellv@uk.uu.net>
	    - don't sort the batch file if using the storageapi. It doesn't
	      necessarily help and causes out-of-order articles when using
	      master-slave mode. The sorting is legacy from trad spool.

	    - From: Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu>

    nnrpd/perl.c:
	    - From: "Edward S. Marshall" <emarshal@xnet.com>
	    - Here's a patch that fixes up innd and nnrpd as well. This
    gives a
	      working INN installation for me, using Perl 5.005_57, the
    latest CVS
	      version of INN, Solaris 7, egcs 1.1.2, largefile support in

  * nnrpd/nnrpd.c (1.49.2.8):
    nnrpd/nnrpd.c:
	    - From: Robert Kiessling <robert@easynet.de>
	    - On some combinations of IRIX and gcc, inet_ntoa does not work
	      properly. Squid therefore integrated a test for a working
    inet_ntoa,
	      which would be a good idea to also include in INN.

Mon Jun 21 00:58:42 1999 David C Lawrence <tale>

  * samples/innmail.in (1.9.2.1):
    trimming trailing newlines off of the subject; the controlchan
    handler scripts variously send the subject with or without a
    newline, so this clears it all up in one place.

  * README (1.5.2.4):
    README:
	    - From: Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu>
	    - INN's README has always struck me as extremely sparse.  One

	      major things it feels like it lacks is some general overview
    for
	      someone who may not be entirely sure what a news server is or
    what

	    - inews always rejects messages if there are duplicate headers
    in
	      message and it's right. But this is often error due to errors
    in
	      sender's setup or errors in mailing software. For avoiding
    this
	      problem I've patched mailpost to remove duplicate headers
    from
	      message before passing it to inews.

    etc., at

    client on
	      the other hand gets confused because there is additional data
    after
	      the single dot, violating the NNTP protocol.

  * lib/getconfig.c (1.48.2.5):
    lib/getconfig.c:
	    - From: Sven Paulus <sven@karlsruhe.org>
	    - INN says "Must set 'domain' in inn.conf" even if the domain
    is set,
	      but the FQDN of the machine does not resolve to a valid IP
    address
	      (e.g. if you call your machine "foo" in domain "bar.com" and
    fail to
	      add "foo" to your DNS zone or /etc/hosts file, there is no
    use
	      setting "domain: bar.com" in inn.conf, the error message
    given by INN
	      will stay the same). This is very confusing

    It's
	      expanded, clarified, and updated from the existing one and I
    believe
	      it comes close to fully documenting the current interface. 
    While I
	      was at it, I reformatted the text into roughly the same style
    used in
	      README and INSTALL.

	    - When the 'html_header' or 'html_footer' options are turned on
    in
	      innreport.conf, innreport fails to update innreport.db and
    the
	      index.html files correctly.  The problem is that the code to
    read in
	      the html headers/footers sets $/ to '' to read in the
    headers/footers
	      all at once, and fails to set $/ back to newline afterwards.

	    - From: Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu>
	    - A doit (or a successful verify-*) action on a checkgroups

	      when it is fed an e-mail, where the body of the message
    starts with
	      a space. (i.e. headers,blank line,space ...)
    
	      The bug is in the code for handling header continuation
    lines. I
	      believe that the following patch fixes the problem, although

	    - From: Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu>
	    - The INN::newsgroup() XS Perl function is supposed to return
    the flags		for a given newsgroup (ngp->Rest).  Unfortunately,
    whoever wrote it
	      originally was unaware that the Rest pointer in a NEWSGROUP
    is just a
	      pointer into the in-memory copy of the active file, and
    therefore
	      this field is *not* null-terminated.  As a result, whenever a
    Perl
	      filter called INN::newsgroup, it would get not only the flags
    for
	      that newsgroup but a complete copy of the active file from
    that point
	      forward.

	    - From: Richard Kettlewell <rjk@greenend.org.uk>
	    - Firstly the reference to a "pound sign" as the comment

    does not

    nnrpd/nnrpd.c:
	    - From: Andrew Gierth <andrew@erlenstar.demon.co.uk>
	    - The original code was correct in this respect. This is why
    accept()
	      et. al. have an additional size parameter for the address.
    The cast
	      is something of a historical crock, but is nevertheless
    correct.

  * samples/cnfsstat.in (1.3.2.4):
    samples/cnfsstat.in:
	    - From: davidsen@tmr.com (bill davidsen)
	    - I don't see in the man pages that you can use continuation
    lines in
	      the cycbufs.conf file, but there's code to handle it, and it
    makes
	      the file a lot easier to read.
    
	      The cnfsstat script doesn't know about this, here's how to
    make it
	      work.  This is just the bugfix, I am not quite ready to
    release my
	      enhancements yet, due to unexplained failure with raw
    partitions

  * nnrpd/nnrpd.c (1.49.2.4):
    nnrpd/nnrpd:
	    - From: davidsen@tmr.com (bill davidsen)
	    - This patch addresses one bug (wrong data type) and one
    missing
	      feature (nicekids). The type was a struct defined as
    sockaddr_in and
	      used with a case where sockaddr was required. Because I'm not
    sure
	      all systems will have the same size for both, and my compiler
    whines
	      about the original, I defined the value correctly and dropped
    the
	      cast.
    
	      When running from innd, a nice() value is gotten from the
    nicekids
	      value in inn.conf. In daemon mode that wasn't being done, so
    I added
	      the code here. Note: you do *not* want to just start the
    daemon
	      niced, as it will then open sockets more slowly (I measured
    with
	      NSLG). Nicekids is the way to go here.

	    - From the "while I'm at it" department: the following patch,

	    - In innd/rc.c(RCwritelist()): I think The DISPOSE(r) is wrong
    - via

    frontends/rnews.c:

	    - The value of PATHBADNEWS is combined using cpcatpath(), which
    only
	      returns a pointer to a fixed buffer (pathbuff in
    lib/getconfig.c).
	      Later - if you use a password protected NNTP connection -
    rnews calls
	      NNTPsendpassword() (lib/sendpass.c) which also uses
    cpcatpath() to
	      construct a path name -> pathbuff gets overwritten and the
    value of
	      PATHBADNEWS is now pure nonsense.

	    - Add ``noresendid'' for non-stream mode.
    samples/news.daily.in:
	    - From: davidsen@tmr.com (bill davidsen)
	    - The news.daily script doesn't properly use the user defined
    temp
	      space for sorts. There's some logic to look and see if TMPDIR
    is
	      defined, build the -T option for sort to use, and then ignore

  * nnrpd/udp.c (1.3.2.2):
    nnrpd/udp.c:
	    - From: Sven Paulus <sven@karlsruhe.org>
	    - This eliminates the calls to perror() and replaces them by
    syslog()s.
	      The perror()s make it impossible to use nnrpd from inetd,
    since the
	      output goes to the NNTP channel, thus violating the NNTP
    specs.

	      I'm more interested in making this work correctly than

	    - This patch sets PERMuser and PERMpass after perl
    authentication so
	      that they reflect the user and password that successfully
	      authenticated, just as when you're using regular
    authentication those
	      variables are set to the required values from the nnrp.access

    the
	      following change: if a post goes to a group that would be
    disallowed
	      by the posting permissions pattern, it will be refused
    regardless of

	      overview data and more detail of what the point of the
    different
	      BUCKETS in overview.ctl is.  I also corrected one place where
    the
	      file had an 80 column line, since it made it somewhat
    annoying to
	      deal with in emacs.  (There's still another 80 column line,
    but
	      that's a literal cron entry example that can't be easily
    shortened
	      and is offset from regular text.)

  * samples/innreport_inn.pm (1.5.2.4):
    samples/innreport_inn.pm:
	    - From: Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu>
	    - this will suppress the cycbuff rollover messages, which
    otherwise
	      show up as unknown log entries.  At some point, someone might
    want to
	      do something more interesting with these, but for right now
    ignoring
	      them seems the best.
    
	      There's also a minor formatting fix with a comment in here.

  * samples/nnrpd_auth.pl.in (1.1.2.1):
    samples/nnrpd_auth.pl.in:
	    - From: Paul Tomblin <ptomblin@xcski.com>
	    - The nnrpd_auth.pl supplied with 2.2-STABLE assumes that the
    hostname
	      patterns in nnrp.access are regular expressions, but they're
    not,
	      they're glob-like.

  * samples/innreport_inn.pm (1.5.2.3):
    samples/innreport_inn.pm:
	    - From: Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu>
	    - With this plus my previous patch that was already applied, I
    think
	      innreport is at least quiet about all of the log messages
    generated
	      routinely by the standard programs in INN 2.2.

  * samples/innreport_inn.pm (1.5.2.2):
    samples/innreport_inn.pm:
	    - From: Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu>
	    - Better yet, fix innreport so that it ignores controlchan's
    output.
	      There may be some statistical summary that I can think of
    that might
	      be useful eventually, and that way you still have the logs
    there in
	      case you ever want them.	Here's a patch:

  * storage/Makefile (1.33.2.1):
    storage/Makefile:
	    - From: Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu>
	    - storage/Makefile creates a storage/objs directory on first
    build, but
	      the clean target, while deleting everything in the directory,
    doesn't
	      delete the directory itself.  That seems wrong to me, and
    makes CVS
	      whine on an update after a build.  Patch following.

  * innd/rc.c (1.31.2.1):
    innd/rc.c:
	    - From: Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu>
	    - I always liked the way innfeed.conf would let you leave off
    the
	      ip-addr key if it was the same as the key of the entry, so I
    fixed
	      incoming.conf so that it would do the same.  Patch attached.

  * Makefile (1.18.2.1):
  * INSTALL (1.19.2.1):

	    - From: Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu>
	    - explain transit only server needs overview
    Makefile:
	    - From: Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu>
	    - I'm not sure the intended semantics of realclean here, but
    I'm pretty
	      sure it's intended to be the same as distclean.  If so, it's
    missing
	      a goodly bit of stuff according to CVS, plus it's convenient
    to have
	      distclean available as an alias for it as well.  Patch
    attached.
    
	      This also removes the following over what was deleted before:

  * configure.in (1.106.2.5):
  * configure (1.104.2.5):
    configure:
    configure.in:
	    - From: Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu>
	    - Additional commands that should run after autoconf generates
    its
	      output files should be put into the second argument of
    AC_OUTPUT
	      rather than just raw into configure.in.  Raw commands will
    correctly
	      get put into the generated configure script, but they *won't*
    be put
	      into config.status.  config.status is very convenient when
    doing a
	      first build and having to patch various things; if you run
	      config.status, it will just redo the variable substitution
    without
	      rerunning configure.  But when I was doing that, the build
    then
	      failed because storage/buildconfig wasn't executable.
    
	      configure just runs config.status to do the substitutions;
    with this
	      patch, the chmod gets put in config.status rather than in
    configure
	      and therefore works correctly both after running configure
    and after
	      running config.status.
