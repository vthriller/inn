 *
 * Utility routines for writing floating point tests.
 *
 * Currently provides only one function, which checks whether a double is
 * equal to an expected value within a given epsilon.  This is broken into a
 * separate source file from the rest of the basic C TAP library because it
 * may require linking with -lm on some platforms, and the package may not
 * otherwise care about floating point.
 *
 * This file is part of C TAP Harness.  The current version plus supporting
 * documentation is at <http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/c-tap-harness/>.
