If you're seeing this file, you have checked INN out of Subversion or
otherwise obtained a copy of the development tree rather than a snapshot
or standard release.  This means that you need to start by bootstrapping
the tree before you can build INN or read much of the documentation.

To do this, run:

    ./autogen
    ./configure
    make bootstrap

You will need to have Autoconf 2.64 or later, Perl, a make that supports
file inclusion, and a compiler installed.  This should generate, among
other things, the README and HACKING files, which you can then read for
more information about INN.

If you have difficulty bootstrapping the source, you should not work from a
Subversion checkout.  Instead, download a snapshot or release and start
working from that.
