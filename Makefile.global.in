##  This file is meant to be the central Makefile that configure works with
##  and that all other Makefiles include.  No Makefile other than this one
##  should have to be a configure substitution target.

##  For installation paths, see the bottom of this file.

##  If you want to install INN relative to a root directory other than /,
##  set DESTDIR to the path to the root directory of the file system.  This
##  won't affect any of the paths compiled into INN; it's used primarily
##  when building a software distribution, where software has to be
##  installed into some file system that will later be mounted as / on the
##  final system.

##  How to install man pages.  Pick one of SOURCE, BSD4.4, NROFF-PACK, or
##  NROFF-PACK-SCO.  Used by doc/man/putman.sh; read that script for more

##  Basic compiler settings.  COPT is the variable to override on the make
##  command line to change the optimization or add warning flags (such as
##  -Wall).  LFS_* is for large file support.  All of INN is built with the
##  large file support flags if provided, just to be sure.  While configure
##  searches out the appropriate flags, no part of INN is currently built
##  threaded.

##  libtool support.  Note that INN does not use Automake (and that
##  retrofitting Automake is likely more work than it's worth), so
##  libtool-aware rules have to be written by hand.  The UP* variants add
##  ../.. instead of just .. and are for use in Makefiles in source
##  directories two levels deep.

##  rules of each separate subdirectory.  The naming scheme is as follows:
##  the first two characters are CP (indicating a plain copy) or LI
##  (indicating an installation that goes through libtool).  After an
##  underscore is a one-character indicator of the file type (R for a
##  regular file, X for an executable, S for a setuid root executable) and
##  then PUB for a world-readable/world-executable file or PRI for a
##  group-readable/group-executable file (only the news group).  inews and
##  rnews have their own special installation rules.
