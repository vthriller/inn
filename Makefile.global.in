##  This file is meant to be the central Makefile that configure works with
##  and that all other Makefiles include.  No Makefile other than this one
##  should have to be a configure substitution target.
##
##  For installation paths, see the bottom of this file.

##  This version information is used to generate lib/version.c and is used
##  by INN for banner and local version identification.  The version
##  identification string will be "$VERSION ($VERSION_EXTRA)", with the
##  parentheses omitted if $VERSION_EXTRA is empty (as it is for major
##  releases).  If you make extensive local modifications to INN, you can
##  put your own version information in $VERSION_EXTRA.  If it's set to
##  "CVS prerelease", the build time will be automatically included.

VERSION         = 2.3.5
VERSION_EXTRA   = CVS prerelease

##  If you want to install INN relative to a root directory other than /,
##  set DESTDIR to the path to the root directory of the file system.  This
##  won't affect any of the paths compiled into INN; it's used primarily
##  when building a software distribution, where software has to be
##  installed into some file system that will later be mounted as / on the
##  final system.

##  How to install man pages.  Pick one of SOURCE, BSD4.4, NROFF-PACK, or

##  Basic compiler settings.  COPT is the variable to override on the make
##  command line to change the optimization or add warning flags (such as
##  -Wall).  LFS_* is for large file support.  All of INN is built with the
##  large file support flags if provided, just to be sure.  While configure
##  searches out the appropriate flags, no part of INN is currently built
##  threaded.

##  libtool support.  Note that INN does not use Automake (and that
##  retrofitting Automake is likely more work than it's worth), so
##  libtool-aware rules have to be written by hand.  The UP* variants add
##  ../.. instead of just .. and are for use in Makefiles in source
##  directories two levels deep.

##  Missing functions.  If non-empty, configure detected that your system

##  (indicating an installation that goes through libtool).  After an
##  underscore is a one-character indicator of the file type (R for a
##  regular file, X for an executable, S for a setuid root executable) and
##  then PUB for a world-readable/world-executable file or PRI for a
##  group-readable/group-executable file (only the news group).  inews and
##  rnews have their own special installation rules.
