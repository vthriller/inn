INN is developed on BSD/OS 2.1. The config.dist file in the config
directory is ready to go for that system, so there is no sample for bsd/os
in this directory. You may want to tweak things (like whether to use the
Perl hooks), though.

The sample config.data files in here have been donated by many people. I
have made some changes to make things (like installed paths) consistent
across all samples. If anything in here is broken, please le me know
